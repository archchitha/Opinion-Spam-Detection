It is very loud and doesn't swing very well. It is beautiful though. I love the colors and it has a lot of settings, but I don't think it was worth the money.

It works and does everything I need. Only issue is that it tilts slightly to one side so when I hit any keys it rocks a little bit. Not a big deal.
5	__label1__	4	N	Beauty	B00PWSAXAM	Shine Whitening - Zero Peroxide Teeth Whitening System - No Sensitivity	Only use twice a week	I only use it twice a week and the results are great. I have used other teeth whitening solutions and most of them, for the same results I would have to use it at least three times a week. Will keep using this because of the potency of the solution and also the technique of the trays, it keeps everything in my teeth, in my mouth.

15	__label1__	4	N	Furniture	B0019QITHK	Boss Caressoft Medical Stool, black	Color Is Accurate	I bought 2 of these in brown for my island. The hydraulic mechanism looks as though it might fail with over use, but otherwise, I really like them. The color is accurate, as is the description. There is some padding, but not much. Definitely not a chair that you would lounge around in, but great for a bar/counter in the kitchen.

I only say this because due to where the left camera is place, there is wasted recording room when you start to turn it towards the driver side. Otherwise very happy with this so far.
18	__label1__	4	N	Sports	B000HE8NK8	Barnett Diablo Slingshot	good enough	As sling shots go, this is good enough for my purposes. Though, I would have preferred for the handle to be slimmer for better grip.

I take it before breakfast, lunch and supper. I don't take the one after supper because I don't tend to eat much in the late evenings. I find it really cuts my down my appetite. I've lost 8 lbs this month, which is WAY more than I've lost in a long time.

It's like they didn't test it to see if it works.
26	__label1__	4	N	Health & Personal Care	B0018KL0YG	Oregano Oil CERTIFIED ORGANIC- Joy of the Mountain - 75% Carvacrol (30mL) Brand: Joy of the Mountain	Did you know? Oregano delivers more antioxidants than blueberries, oranges or apples	My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/wa7AI ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />I was told the enormous benifit of Oregano: it is one of the most powerful healing herbs and natural anti-biotics ever studied. It has been found in a recent study to be significantly better than all of the 18 currently used anti-biotics in the treatment of MRSA staph infections. The strong phenol anti-oxidants destroy pathogenic bacteria, viruses and yeasts. This super herb is very rich in anti-oxidant phytochemical flavonoids and phenolic acids. It is the third highest herb in oxygen radical absorbancy capacity (ORAC) with an impressive score of 200,129. The USDA ranks oregano's antioxidant capacity anywhere from 3 to 20 times higher than any other herb.<br /><br />You can see 2 bottles Oreganol P73 in my fridge. Wowww ... this oregano oil is just the best, it works miraculously! I had discomfort and dryness in my throat, then I took a couple drops of this oil in a tablespoon of water and drank it. This oil healed and soothed my throat almost instantly, and feel great up to now. Another time I felt my body so aching, then I took this oil in the same way - it set me free and felt great just in seconds. This oil is fantastic!!! I also have used oregano as emergency medicine to completely eliminate digestive distress after eating what I found out was contaminated food.

We tried 2 before this one & took both back. You cannot feel the wires and the material is very luxurious. I did feel it was quite pricey...about $50 more than the ones we took back. However, that being said, the quality indicates it will last for years.

It will allow you to set your table very decoratively, and the beauty of a white dinnerware set is that it goes with any color scheme! Before acquiring this particular dinnerware set, I already owned a plain white set of dinnerware; but this set with the platinum rim is much nicer.

It did take a lot of hair off my face which I love because I hate peach fuzz	Since I have a low pain tolerance this facial hair remover didn't hurt very much. It did take a lot of hair off my face which I love because I hate peach fuzz, especially when wearing foundation. The tweezers were okay, loved the color but it was a little hard for me to use. Wish the package was bubble wrapped because it was so cute but mine got smashed in the process of shipping. Great customer service!!
35	__label1__	3	N	Camera	B0049I48JI	Nikon Deluxe Digital SLR Camera Case - Gadget Bag	hard to accommodate	The bag looks like a little smaller version than the one in the picture.

This mask is great for the purpose of keeping out the light for sure! My hubs gets up at 4am to go work and he is a butthead by turning on all the lights. Since getting this, Ive havent had any issues sleeping through it! lol. It looks like a mini bra because its not like your traditional flat sleep masks that lay flat over your eyes. This one has little &#34;cups&#34; that doesnt touch your eyelids at all which is nice because with my old sleep mask it made me itchy. The only reason why I didnt give this 5 stars is because whenever I turned to sleep on my sides it kinda made it uncomfortable to sleep with it on. I had to sleep on my back to make it stay on. For me I hate sleeping on my back so :(

39	__label1__	4	N	Health & Personal Care	B005HXTMYA	Protocol For Life Balance - Red Yeast Rice Plus 600 mg 90 vcaps	The best natural product to lower cholesterol	My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/5Zi8I , 600mg a tablet for only 5 cents, additional with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />Recent biochemical and pharmacological studies have identified red yeast rice as a beneficial supplement for maintaining a healthy balance of cholesterol and related lipids in the body. Studies have reported lowering of LDL and triglycerides while increasing HDL. A clinical study on patients who have suffered a heart attack found that a partially purified extract of red yeast rice, reduced the risk of repeat heart attacks by 45 revascularization (bypass surgery/angioplasty), cardiovascular mortality, and total mortality by one-third; and cancer mortality by two-thirds.<br /><br />A recent study has found that nattokinase combined with red yeast rice can significantly lower cholesterol. I use it with Best Nattokinase( goo.gl/32EeB ) and this does a fabulous job of reducing my LDL and overall cholesterol( from 220 to 150 ). Amazing!

41	__label1__	4	N	Beauty	B000F5PM4E	Elon Matrix 5,000 - Vitamin for Hair 60 tablets	My husband commented on how good my hair looks since I started this, thick, clear and even toned	My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/5Hndv ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />My personal physician told me that Biotin's role is multi-faceted and the vitamin is used for a number of different purposes.<br />1) Hair, Skin, Nails: Biotin is said to help grow healthy hair, is good for the skin and is used to help treat brittle toe and fingernails. Biotin is also used to treat hair loss (alopecia), and for people with premature gray hair due to low levels of biotin, it has helped combat graying hair.<br />2) Treatment of Candida: Some people use biotin to treat Candida because it is said to be able to prevent yeast from changing into its fungal form.<br />3) Fat Burner: Biotin is often promoted as a "fat burner" because one of the principle roles of biotin is to help with the metabolism of fats, proteins and carbs.<br />4) Reduce Blood Sugar: In some cases, doctors recommend biotin to help people with type 2 diabetes reduce their blood sugar.<br />5) Gene Replication: On a deeper level, biotin is integral for gene replication.<br />6) Blood Cells and Bone Marrow: Biotin also helps in the production of healthy blood cells and bone marrow.<br /><br />My hair was thinning from working at a very stressful job. It had gotten to the point where I couldn't successfully make a ponytail. I decided to have a try. After using the Biotin for 3 months, I am happy to report stronger, thicker hair. I haven't seen much growth in the length, but it is very much thicker, prettier, and more manageable. It's so much so that my hairdresser was very surprised! When I went to her to get a trim 2 months after the last haircut, it had grown to the level which would normally have taken 3 months at least to reach :)

44	__label1__	4	N	Health & Personal Care	B00028P640	Natural Factors Pycnogenol Pine Bark 25mg Capsules, 60-Count	The Gift of Life from Trees! Fountain of youth	My personal physician recommended this and I bought at goo.gl/xv1lP ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />He told that the extract of pine bark has a beneficial effect in treating over 50 diseases associated with the effects of free radicals, and also provides prevention against them:<br />1) Asthma<br />2) Chronic venous insufficiency (a condition that involves leg swelling, 3) varicose veins, pain, itching, and other skin changes)<br />4) High blood pressure (hypertension)<br />5) Retinopathy (an eye condition commonly caused by diabetes)<br />6) Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)<br />7) Blood clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis)<br />8) Diabetes<br />9) Impotence (also known as erectile dysfunction or ED)<br />10) High cholesterol<br />11) Male infertility<br />12) Heart attacks or strokes<br />13) Leg cramps<br />14) Pregnancy pains (such as back pain, pelvic pain, and leg cramps)<br />15) Painful menstrual periods (dysmenorrhea).<br />16) Pycnogenol is also said to improve athletic performance.<br /><br />"So, tell me what it cant heal?" I asked. But whatever I had a try. I use it in my type 2 diabetes herbal treatment regimen and to add preventative circulatory and longevity potential to my life one veggie cap at a time. I have been taking this pycogenol for about a month so far and the main thing I have noticed is that my allergies/cough have pretty much gone away completely. At the beginning of January this year I got sick with a pretty bad cold and have had a cough ever since that is only at night and in the morning. My doctor told me that it was most likely allergies or asthma, neither of which I have had before. The pycogenol is the only thing I have added to my regimen of vitamins/supplements in the past month and now my cough is gone.Yay!! I am also hoping this will help with my diabetes which was the reason that I started taking it so hopefully I can report back seeing a benefit on that soon too. I plan to starttaking this twice a day instead of once so I'm hoping that will help.

They probably should have asked me first what i thought, but here it goes. I bought it for use with my appradio3 and paid an additional $20 to have it installed. After about 2 days, it would not allow video to display constantly and just kept flashing between the warning message and the video about every 6 or 7 seconds. It was like one second of video followed by 6-7 seconds of warning message. It would do it over and over and got really annoying. I took it back to my installer, and they said it was installed correctly. I had no amps, or other stuff and my car does not need a radio module (older car here with no fancy computer stuff except for new pioneer radio). I agreed to an additional $30 removal to have the bypass bench tested and it did the same thing on the bench. The installer fed power to the blue and black wires, and connected an alarm led to the green wire. It did the same flashing on the bench it did in the car. For $20, i dont want to deal with the hassle of returning it, but it cost me more out of pocket and time to make it worth it. I do not know if the seller should be responsible for this, but i did lose out a lot of money due to their product so I am not sure if I should pursue it. I ended up buying another bypass from another company, and it has worked fine for over a month now. Maybe I just got a bad one or what, but it sucked to have to deal with it. Just my $.02 so take it or leave it. My emails to the company through their website still have went unanswered to date, and its been weeks. I searched online about this and diybypass is really a no-name company so go figure.

She can say circle and star now, and recognizes some others when she plays with her [[ASIN:B0089W1IGG Baby's First Blocks]]. She can also count from one to five, and names a few letters here and there.<br /><br />I give the videos credit that they hold her attention and she has learned a lot from them. They are slow paced and not too flashy like most cartoons on TV. The animations are colorful and the music is decent.<br /><br />However, they get boring for adults to watch. The videos repeat the word over and over again, which gets tiring for me to listen to. In all fairness the repetition definitely helps her to learn faster so I guess I should just deal with it.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* The videos work well.<br />* My daughter loves them.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* Boring for adults to watch.

114	__label1__	4	N	Health & Personal Care	B004Q8JH9M	Pampers Cruisers Diapers Size 4 Economy Pack Plus,160 Count	Good for mobility	We changed from swaddlers to cruisers when our baby started to crawl excessively. The diapers moved with her better and gave a lot better coverage. Swaddlers were not so leak proof with an active baby. I think she also likes the these better- she seems to smile when she sees them. There've been some changes in the last pack compared to original cruisers though. There liner is the same color as the diaper again and they're thinner. Sometimes the thinner consistency poses a problem, sometimes it does not. It really depends on the day and how much she's gotta go.<br /><br />They seem to hold well overnight- no leaks, but it's not as dry either. As a result, our poor little Lucy has got some diaper rash a few times. She's a screamer when she's got it bad. In those instances we use a heavy strength rash cream by bourdeaux butt paste brand: [[ASIN:B00BMIT1U4 All Natural Boudreaux's Butt Paste Diaper Rash Ointment + FREE Aveeno Baby Daily Moisture Lotion]]. It absorbs well so it's not left all messy and residue on the diaper when you put a fresh one on. Anything still there at the next change wipes right off her bottom with ease too.

119	__label1__	4	N	Health & Personal Care	B004Q8LL9Q	Pampers Baby Dry Diapers Economy Plus Pack Size 1, 276 Count	Good diaper on the right baby	There's a lot of mixed reviews...I just want to start by saying each diaper is going to work differently on each baby! They're not all shaped the same, they don't all go to the bathroom the same. It takes patience to find the right diaper for your baby. Just because my friend prefers swaddlers doesn't mean I do too. The Pampers Baby Dry is a good fit for my child. She's pretty small and long. I've noticed my friends with fuller, thicker babies don't have as much good luck. But for me, this is a great, thin, super-absorbant diaper that works well. The price is a great value as well.<br /><br />Be aware though, no diaper will elimnate diaper rash! Despite how absorbant your diaper choice is, your baby will still at some point have diaper rash. My best luck has been butt paste diaper cream ([[ASIN:B00BMIVQ3E All Natural Boudreaux's Butt Paste + FREE Baby Ganics Thick N' Kleen (Fragrance Free) Baby Wipes]]) because it seals up the sensitive skin and I can still re-diaper my girl right away without a lot of fuss. With diaper rash and rash cream, make sure the diaper doesn't rub anywhere to hard and that they've got some flexibility. The Baby Dry leaves plenty of room for my baby.

I purchased Herbalife a few months ago at my local health retailer and had high hopes for this with the numerous good reviews I read. Although, after using it for 6 weeks fairly regularly, I was very disappointed.<br /><br />Normally people keep eating unhealthy or don't stay active during the use of these kinds of products, but I didn't do that at all. I honestly didn't lose more than 2 pounds at any time during the use of this product. It was hard to comprehend that even after that much regular use, I wasn't losing weight.<br /><br />After realizing this, I decided to try something new. After consulting with friends and family, I went with a product that has been nothing short of AMAZING. I have lost 23 pounds in the last 7 weeks and I have never felt better. This is only the start! I get emotional typing this because I struggled for so long to find something that worked for me.<br /><br />If you want to actually lose weight, take a look at this item here on Amazon and give it a chance ---------&#62; http://amzn.to/1jSaoQQ<br /><br />Even if you decide it's not the product for you, I'm at least glad I could share my experience about this product and how it did not work for me. I am walking proof that there is SOMETHING out there that works!

If you want a fast acting balm that doesn't have the real effect, don't buy this. If you want something that will take some time but bring long term results, this is the best balm on the market.

156	__label1__	2	N	Sports	B000UEP0NI	FitDeck Bodyweight	Full and Complete Review of Fit Deck Bodyweight	I am a collector of fitness products, there are three exercise cards on the market (Workout Labs, Strength Stack 52 and Fit Deck) and I will post a brief review of all three here. Just a bit about myself, I am 5 foot 10 somewhat athletic and would consider myself a little above average in terms of my fitness level.<br />Fit Deck<br />Fit Deck has been around for a few years now. I would place them second behind Strength Stack 52 in terms of the quality of workout you can get with these. They have a ton of different decks like bodyweight and basketball and even tai chi, to be fair, I only purchased the bodyweight cards though. Like Workout Labs the exercises were still very basic and lacked the neat gaming component that Strength Stack provides. The owner is a former navy seal (from many years ago), which helps the product, but if you look at him, he has very little muscle tone, which gets me a bit weary.<br />About $16/deck, not very happy with these since they lack any benefit for someone of intermediate or advanced fitness level. If you are a beginner and have no knowledge of working out, you can get these cards, but again, no reason to buy them if Strength Stacks are in stock.<br />Strength Stack 52<br />In my opinion the best of the three workout card companies. From the design to the game play, these cards have some really neat features. Every card has a QR code. The code can be scanned with any Smartphone and a video of the exercise on the card will show me how to do the exercise. Each card is numbered and suited and even color coded by body type. The website has some cool games you can play with the cards, but my buddy and I made up a few of our own. The inventor of the cards, Sergeant Volkin is a military fitness expert and you can tell by looking at him.<br />The best feature of these cards is the exercises themselves. Both Fit Deck and Workout Labs have very basic exercises, Strength Stack has exercises that are dynamic and fun, some of which I have neverseen before.<br />About $16/deck, really great deal, these are the cards I still use months after my purchase.<br />Workout Labs<br />This is the worst of the three exercise cards available. The creator of the cards has no muscle tone, no background in fitness or extraordinary fitness level (to my knowledge) , these cards are purely a marketing play as the owner outright claims he is a designer only. The cards are very, very basic, appealing only to beginners. When I got my cards in the mail, I noticed they were of good quality and waterproof in case you drip sweat on them. But, I have yet to sweat using these cards.<br />PLEASE NOTE: The reviews on this product are fake. I have clicked on almost all of the 5 star reviews and everyone one of them have only reviewed this product. You can even tell they are fake by the way they are written, a bit too perfect. That got me wary of purchasing the cards in the first place, but I still did.<br />The cards are divided into a male and female deck, which is  odd since fitness is unisex. There was nothing to do when I got the cards besides flip a card and look at the illustrations. Given the fact that they were $25 for a single deck of cards, I was hoping for much, much more as there are only 40 basic exercises in the deck. All in all, very disappointed with these.<br /><br />I hope this review helped, I was not paid in any way to review any of these companies.

I do a lot of running, and have recently began having some minor joint discomfort in my left knee and hip as a result of training for a marathon. After speaking with my Dr about the pain, he said that I should look at Glucosamine supplements to see if they could help. So over the past few months I have tried a few other products I found in GNC like Instaflex, and GNC's own Triflex and while I noticed a slight difference with each of them I just continued looking to find something that would help noticeably alleviate the pain. I hate taking aspirin and ibuprofen as they both have a tendency to upset my stomach, and like the fact that it is more natural. My running partner recommended this to me, and what I noticed was that it really helped with the pain. I wouldn't say that the relief came immediately, but over about a week I noticed that the pain in my joints was much less, and my joints began to have just a more &#34;smooth&#34; feeling while running. I don't know how else to describe it, but I just don't get that rough feeling I would usually get after a week of running. It is a bit more expensive than I would like which is why I only gave it 4 stars, but I have to admit it has really helped me out.

The look and feel of them is cool but there is definitely work to be done if these are to be sold for $100.<br /><br />After dealing with these I got myself a good headset that I absolutely love. The sound quality is great and I haven't found a single thing to complain about in over two months of use. I can wear them for hours on end with no issue!<br /><br />If you want a great headset, check out this pair here on Amazon -----------&#62; http://amzn.to/1qp9Fhd<br /><br />I hope I could help others out by sharing my experience with these headsets, you won't regret getting the pair I did!

For a long time I began to let those things slip away because I was constantly in pain and aching.

Any tribulus product that contains 45% Saponins, is simply not going to compare to a tribulus that contains a high concentration of Protodioscin (the main ingredient responsible for the benefits I gets when taking tribulus).  The most potent form of tribulus is extracted at a ratio of 90%, [[ASIN:B007RLZDBQ Tribulus Terrestris 90% Bulk Powder 50 Grams]].  Even than I would still recommend combining it with some longjack or DAA, if increasing testosterone levels is your main motivation for taking it in the first place.

10700	__label2__	5	N	Tools	B008NM6VSC	Crescent DB18X 18-Inch Indexing Flat Pry bar, Red/Black	A perfect demo tool	I confess...if I had to pick a favorite part of a home project, it would have to be demo.  There's just something...satisfying about knocking down something that's bugged you enough to want to renovate it.  It speaks to that prehistoric reptilian portion of our brains.<br /><br />This is a very good tool, not just for general demo but for uses where a crowbar would be too big.  First check:  it's heavy and sturdy, which is something that a good breaker bar/demo tool should be.  It's solid and substantial.<br /><br />Second check: it has a good handle.  The handle is important, not just for giving you a good grip, but for absorbing vibrations when you go to town on something.  Indeed, the head has a nice flat spot that doubles as a, ahem, &#34;percussive tool&#34; to slam the heck out of things.  And it works.<br /><br />Third check: it's versatile.  By that I mean it has an adjustable head.  This means if you need to pry something at an odd angle, you can adjust the head and get a 90 degree angle from the handle and whatever you're prying.  This makes life a LOT easier.<br /><br />In sum, this is the archetypal demo tool, easy to use and built to last.  I love it.

A bit on the pricey side for a tumbler.<br />- Size. Due to it's size (girth) it does not fit well or at all in some vehicle cupholders.<br /><br />~TIPS~<br />- Do not let colored drinks to sit in the tumbler for too long.

I took this with me on vacation since my oldest is highly allergic to disposable diapers.  I typically use and wash the diapers every few days.  However on vacation I didn't have access to a washer.  For 5 days I piled diapers into the 3 Itzy Ritzy bags I have.  We threw them in the back of our Durango thinking surly the smell on the way home would be horrible.  They never leaked and one ended up upside down and the smell never leaked out.  Now the smell when I did open it was nasty but I expected that.  The only downside to this bag is it wont hold as many diapers as some of the competitors.

I like the 2 packs. the sticks in the bag I opened I vacuum sealed in mason jars they look pretty on  my shelf as well as being quite comforting. I ground a few sticks for pumpkin pies, placed a few sticks on the back burner to scent the house. The sticks I ground to use in my fresh pumpkin pies, breads and muffins were very fragrant. They were spicy and warm. My house smelled good and with 2 enormous dogs, two horses in the yard and surrounded by chickens and cows, that's a very good thing.

I've had a few over the years but this is by far the best.<br /><br />Here are the reasons:<br /><br />!. The wooden ones that fold don't hold up.  With the weight being put on them, or them getting knocked over at times, those kind usually wear out in a year.  This one has no folding parts and when you put it together, it can't come apart, It holds sturdy.<br /><br />2. It comes with a washable cover. This makes it not only look prettier, but these things get coated in fur.  No need for them to stay that way now.  One quick wash and you are good.<br /><br />3. The carpeted top makes the stairs easy for even a little dog to learn to go up and down and keep their footing, but with no grooves that trap fur and make it hard to vacuum up.<br /><br />4. Taller height for even a really tall bed.<br /><br />5. Attractive as far as these steps go.<br /><br />Instant learning...happy to have it.  Easy to put together.

10713	__label2__	5	Y	Grocery	B001PQREKM	McCormick Ground Cinnamon, 18 oz.	Gardening aid which works! yes, for gardening	I have to admit that I did not buy this to eat or cook with.<br />I've been starting seedlings for years, but this year got damping off (died) of most of the young seedlings. So I searched for a safe product to use to kill the mold or fungus, whatever it is that attacks young seedling plants. I had used a chemical, actually 2 different chemicals, both labeled for damping off, but to no avail.<br /><br />So I wanted something different.<br />I had soaked and scrubbed everything in bleach, soap, hot water overnight, and some pots were NEW. I used only specified starter soil, from a tightly sealed NEW bag. Yet, all except 1 tomato plant had survived...we're talking about 2 dozen pots of different veggies and flowers!<br /><br />Cinnamon was recommended...yes good ole ground cinnamon, along with the other precautions, obviously.<br />Well, I must say that IT WORKS! Cinnamon can prevent damping off in seedlings. I knew I needed a lot to sprinkle on, and scratch into the top layer of soil, so I came to Amazon looking for a big bottle. LOL<br /><br />Bottom line: I have 2 pots of healthy little seedlings, with 2nd set of leaves, growing under lights. They smell great...like a cinnamon cake. :)
10714	__label2__	4	Y	Health & Personal Care	B005MFIR5S	Huggies OverNites Diapers, Size 4, Big Pack, 60 Count	Almost 12 hours	Our daughter doesn't quite sleep as long as she should. An average 10 hour night is fine in these diapers. I would say 12 hours is a stretch. She has peed through them, but overall they are a miracle compared to standard daytime diapers.
10715	__label2__	4	N	Electronics	B007B5WHTE	Philips CSS2123B/F7 Soundbar with Subwoofer (Black)	Decent for the price.	I bought this along with a similar model, the HTL7180, for the same $99 price. I wanted to compare. The CSS sounds much better. The sound is smoother. The bass is fuller. The dialogue is clearer. The remote seems better. And overall, the CSS is a big improvement over the older HTL, which is still for sale, but apparently discontinued. I returned that one to Walmart.<br />I have the CSS hooked up to a new model 32 inch Vizio smart TV with built-in apps. It's a master bedroom application. I think I will keep this unit since it performs well enough. It sounds better on music actually, than as a movie soundbar. Its simulated surround sounds sounds better than the HTL also. That one sounded like too much reverb. I wouldn't turn this unit up much past 30% unless your ears are oblivious to distortion.<br />The remote has adjustments for bass and treble, but they are minimal. This improves on the sounds of the TV speakers, obviously. A bonus is that its not too tall so it doesn't interfere with the TV infrared remote.<br />I have a feeling  the whole TV soundbar craze is going to disappear soon as TV makers figure out ways to make tvs sound better without all this extra junk cluttering up rooms. Soundbars will probably go the way of VHS players and Sony Walkmen in due time. But until then, this $99 unit serves the purpose adequately.

My bad. I took the radio out walking with me and it works fine, and it picks up a lot of AM and FM stations. I guess the reception inside my house is bad for some reason, but out in the open this radio performs very well. Sound is a bit tinny, but that's to be expected for such a small radio and at such a low price. I'm glad I bought it. It does what I wanted it to do: allow me to pick up NPR and the local classical music station when I'm doing my daily walk.  As a bonus, I can also pick up the CBS AM station (740, KCBS) in San Francisco, which is a great source of Bay Area traffic and weather information, updated every 10 minutes.
10718	__label2__	5	N	Pet Products	B00QHC02EY	AmazonBasics Waterproof Car Bench Seat Cover for Pets	Useful and worth it for peace of mind	We like this car seat cover a lot. Our use case isn't very demanding -- we have a small car (Toyota Yaris) and a small dog (Jack Russell). Pet hair isn't much of a problem because his are thick little white hairs that are easy to remove with a lint roller, but it is nice having a cover over the seats to act as a barrier for wetness and dirt. The cover also doubles as a tarp for hiding boxes and items left in the back seat or hatch when we leave them in the car for storage or moving. When it gets dirty, it can be unfastened and scrubbed/hosed down.  Useful and affordable, it's a small price to pay to keep your seats clean(er).
10719	__label2__	5	N	Grocery	B00MLPXPD6	Bakol Jel Dessert, Strawberry, 3 Ounce (Pack of 12)	cleaner alternative to Jello.  Not as firm or brightly colored, but SO much better for you!	We stopped eating Jello years ago, because of the toxic dyes, fake flavoring and other crap ingredients.  I (ok, my daughter) spotted this Bakol Jel Strawberry dessert in the grocery store last week (about $3.50 a package) and was very happy to see this cleaner, non gmo version.  It's made with 100% natural ingredients, non gmo, gluten free, and certified vegan.  It is not as vibrant as usual Jello, but so what.  It's so much better for you, so try to deal with it.  We tried making the Jel in our old Jello molds, and it actually came out ok, not as firm as jello but it still held its shape.  However, it is more watery, so when making it, I decrease the water it calls for a bit.  Also, if you let the set Jel warm to room temperature, it becomes very runny.  The taste is good though, very strawberry, but not in the intense, fake and artificial way.  If you are expecting something exactly like Jello, you will be disappointed.  If you have been searching for a cleaner alternative to jello, give this Bakol Jel a chance. We are happy to have found it, because the kids can finally have (occasionally) their gelatin dessert. The ingredients are: evaporated cane juice, vegetable gum, citric acid, potassium citrate, natural flavor, beet powder. I apologize for taking a picture of it on an orange plate, it's hard to see the color (which is a pale pink).  The Jel had been completely devoured by the kids before I could correct my mistake!

The luminous part of the hand is at the tip, and this did not help much. The quality seemed good, and I do have another type of momentum.

10733	__label2__	4	Y	Sports	B004WN7OGE	ProActive ProMark Stencil	It works well enough	I used to buy and play with only brand-new balls.  Then I remembered how terrible I was at golf, and kept losing them.  So, now I only use second hand Callaways.  Which has been great - I like the brand and not everyone uses them.  Or so I thought.  People I have been playing with ALSO use Callaway balls, and since mine are all different, I never know what # was on my ball, or what exact kind of Callaway it was.  I'd been looking for a nice way to mark my balls, without being too obnoxious.  I didn't want to scrawl my initials on there, or draw a line, or a picture of a whale or what-not.  That's how I decided on this gadget.  I can use it to cleanly and neatly mark my initials on a ball.<br />The contraptions works like this:  It's a blue shell that fits over the golf ball. There's a clear section which fits inside between the ball and the cover.  There's another part of the blue cover that you screw on to the underside of the ball.  The ball fits snugly inside, and you can rotate the clear inner ring to get to the letter or number you need.  It rotates fairly cleanly: it sort of "clicks" with each rotation, so that it holds relatively steady when you are trying to fill in your letter or number.<br />-<br />It's not the best device:<br />- It's hard to screw the bottom thing on.  You really have to press and turn to get it to fit correctly, and many times, mine wasn't all the way on, or the ball would move as I was trying to do this and so it would mess up where I wanted to put my initials.<br />- The inner ring is steady, but not great.  It can move around a little while trying to shade in a character.  It's really not all that bad, but you do have to be careful.  I hold the device so that my hand presses down on the inner ring as well to hold it steady.<br />--<br />It does work OK:<br />- The included pen works well, and it dries quickly and doesn't smudge.<br />- It's stable enough so that I can get my intials on there fairly decently.<br />----<br />The blue shell also has a line on it if you need to draw a line on your ball - some people do that for alignment I guess.<br />I do recommend this device.  I am happy with the results, and it's certainly priced right!!!
10734	__label2__	2	N	Video DVD	B007IJKQRS	Gone	GONE AND QUICKLY FORGOTTEN	GONE is a by the numbers thriller that offers an interesting premise but unfortunately left me disappointed.<br />No matter how cute Amanda Seyfried may be, I've never felt she had the maturity to carry a movie (MAMMA MIA, IN TIME, LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD), and of course she has most of the screen time in GONE.  The real problem is the script makes her do reckless and often stupid things that are pretty unbelievable.  A good supporting cast is basically wasted in roles that serve only as people for Seyfried to "bounce off of."  This includes Daniel Sunjata, DEXTER's Jennifer Carpenter, Wes Bentley, Nick Searcy, Joel David Moore and Michael Pare.<br />The film also has no twist ending, concluding rather flat.<br />A more imaginative script may have distinguished the movie but GONE is easily forgotten.

10737	__label2__	5	Y	Pet Products	B007HT7HH6	1000ct Live Crickets, Large Size Crickets	Great for supplemental feeding of Purple Martins...	These crickets are great for supplemental feeding of Purple Martins during times when they are unable to feed on flying insects due to inclement weather (temperatures below 40 degrees, excessive rain, wind or fog, periods of excessive heat and drought). Crickets are similar to grasshoppers which are a natural part of a Martin's diet.<br /><br />When the crickets arrive, place the box in the freezer overnight. Once frozen, open the box and separate numbers of them into multiple zip lock bags. This way you can take them out of the freezer one bag full at a time and allow them to thaw and reach room temperature for feeding to your Martins. When you open the shoebox size box you will find the crickets within several layers of cardboard egg crate material. The best and least messy way to remove the crickets is to lay several sheets of newspaper on a non-carpeted floor (if available) and shake the contents of the egg crate material and the box onto it. Then when you are done sorting and bagging the crickets you can simply fold up and discard of the newspaper and with it the cricket "debris" (food remains and feces).<br /><br />Martins must be trained to accept the crickets as food, so you need to wait until such time as they are unable to feed on flying insects and are hungry before attempting supplemental feeding for the first time. Then you can use a plastic spoon to flip crickets into the air for your Martins to "catch" by putting a cricket in the bowl of the spoon and holding the handle of the spoon with your dominant hand while using the index finger of your other hand to pull back on the top/tip of the bowl of the spoon slightly bending the spoon and flicking/flipping the cricket straight up and airborne near enough and within the Martins eyesight. If the Martins are perched on their housing, flip the crickets up near them so that they can see them. If they begin to fly keep flipping crickets when they are near and especially when they are flying lower to the ground. The first time I tried this the Martins had been suffering through a week of constantly cold, rainy weather in which no insects were moving. At first only two of my Martins flew to "catch" the crickets I sent airborne, but on the 3rd day of attempted supplemental feeding, the rest of the Martins were just so hungry that as they watched the two Martins that were flying and "catching" the crickets they eventually gave in to their hunger and joined in, too.<br /><br />If you plan on trying to feed Martins that are already too weak to fly you can try placing some crickets in their gourds or housing.<br /><br />Crickets, mealworms and pieces of cooked beef heart can be offered on raised feeding platforms, too. These platforms can be purchased from the Purple Martin Conservation Association (purplemartin.org) which is a non-profit organization dedicated to the conservation of Purple Martins.<br /><br />If your Martins are already used to accepting crushed egg shells or [[ASIN:B00AOJOBSE crushed oyster shells]] from a platform, they will more quickly accept supplemental feeding from platforms. Martins readily eat egg shells and crushed oyster shells and also feed them to their young as a source of grit and calcium. Extra calcium is extremely important for female Martins to produce strong eggs, and also for growing babies. A Martin's normal diet has plenty of protein, but they must get calcium in other ways. They will collect pieces of clam shell, fish bones, mussels, and snail shells from nearby lakes, rivers, ponds and creeks on their own, but can conserve precious energy spent in search of them when provided crushed eggs shells or crushed oyster shells. Just remember that chicken egg shells must be rinsed in cold water and then baked in a 200 degree oven for 10 minutes to kill bacteria such as salmonella before crushing them.<br /><br />NOTE: Many Martin landlords feed their birds scrambled eggs and while this may be okay in a pinch to feed to adult birds in inclementweather when their normal diet of flying insects is not available, scrambled eggs have high fat content and should not be fed regularly. Scrambled eggs are also not recommended for nestlings. Long term use of scrambled eggs will cause loose stool/diarrhea due to the high fat content. Cooked beef heart can be offered as a substitute to or alongside of mealworms and crickets, but ONLY BEEF and not pork.<br /><br />Also, mealworms and crickets can be sprinkled with calcium (in the form of crushed and powdered Calcium 600mg w/D tablets) before feeding to Martins in order to give them the calcium they need in their diet.

Initially, I was afraid my daughters would be be a little bit scared of it's size (about 3 feet), but they loved her.  They called her Kanga and Roo from the cast of  Winnie the Pooh.  It's sturdy and stiff that it  can stand on it's own, but it's soft enough to be huggable.  The small kangaroo is adorable and something that the kids could take with them to bed.  It fits perfectly in the pouch and stays there while my daughter moves the big mommy kangaroo around.  The fur is smooth and so far no shedding has occurred.  If I am to be critical and look for a negative thing about it, it is that the face is a bit expressionless, some stuffed toys have a 'happy' face, I can't really say that for this one.  With that being said, this is still a well made toy and looks it would last years.  If your child is an animal lover this is definitely a great addition to their collection.

The gameplay is standard for most TPS or FPS style but unlike most of the other shooter games this is a game of cat and mouse where you have can't take on a battalion of soldiers but ducking and firing so much as finding a hard to spot area and taking out your enemy from a distance then moving to another area before the enemy finds your location pretty much like a sniper.<br /><br />The controls for the most part are also pretty straight forward nothing to fancy or hard to learn with a little Splinter Cell esque effect put into play,meaning when you take out a an enemy that the other enemies if they see where your shot came from the game will show a ghostly white after image of where the enemy saw you.

So, power it up, connect it to your network, and let it check for updates.  If there are any updates, you will get a `New firmware is available' message.  The steps to update firmware are:<br />Press `Home' on the remote.  There is also a Home icon displayed on your TV screen.<br />Press `OK' to enter `Setup'<br />Select `Player Settings/System/Firmware Update'.  Respond OK to any prompts.<br /><br />The unit is just under 17" wide, about 1 ½" tall, and just over 7" deep.  It weighs 3 pounds.  The top right has, from left to right, the Open/close button, Stop, Start, and the Power/Standby buttons.  The front panel has the disc tray, remote control sensor, a flip down panel which reveals a SD and USB port, and the main display.  The rear panel has the AC cord port, HDMI port, Ethernet jack, and an optical (digital audio) port.<br /><br />I had no problem connecting the player to my wireless network, following the typical steps, providing my security passcode, etc.  The player sits about 50 feet from my router.<br /><br />The player is compatible with Android, versions 4.2 or higher/Mira certified.  I do not have an Android phone.  But a couple of my friends do, and I had them connect while at my house.  They had no issues.  I also had no problems with response for other DLNA devices, such as my Windows 7 laptop.  Response was fast.  I know a lot of people have complained in this aspect.  As with any response problem involving a network, the network must always be considered.  If you have an older (slower) or problematic network or broadband service, you will probably see issues on this device too.<br /><br />I am running FIOS at 50MBps down/25MBps up, but was at 35/35 when I installed the BDT-230.  I have the standard FIOS Actiontec `G' router, but I use an 802.11N router in front of it, so my thru-put between wireless devices is `N' (for devices that "handshake" at that speed).<br /><br />Again, I also upgraded the Panasonic firmware right out of the box, so that probably addressed a couple of fixes.<br /><br />As far as general performance, the player yields a great picture off Blu Ray, just like pretty much any other Blu Ray player.  I still have a lot of DVDs.  I found these rendered very nicely from the player onto my 50" Panasonic TV.<br />I am familiar with Viera as my TV has it as well.  I found navigating it and using it fine, and just as responsive as my TV.  I use it for Amazon Prime and Netflix.<br /><br />I know some reviews complain about advertisements.  There is an ad option on the player.  It is off on mine, but can be turned on.  I left it off, of course!<br /><br />I really like the player and overall I would order it again.<br /><br />There are two things I don't like about it.<br />1.  The HDMI is the ONLY physical AV jack, so you cannot hook this up to any TV, etc. lacking an HDMI port.<br />2. It does not play DVD-Ram media.  These do not play, even if finalized.  I actually have some DVD RAM, including many family videos I transferred from VHS eons ago.  Panasonic, who made DVD-Ram a staple of their product line, should not have products on which DVD-Ram cannot be played.<br /><br />These two things keep me from rating the player a `5', which it is in all other respects.

10754	__label2__	3	N	Video DVD	B006ZV6Y8A	Luci Mie Traditrici	Delightfully innovative opera, but this DVD release is flawed	The Italian composer Salvatore Sciarrino is both steeped in tradition and deeply avant-garde at the same time. Inspired by the classical canon, he nonetheless transforms that inheritance through extended techniques: strings play ghostly harmonics, wind performers overblow notes or produce multiphonics. Take, for example, his &#34;Sei Capricci&#34; for violin (1976, best heard on [[ASIN:B000GLKKT4 Coviello disc]]) where what looks like conventional Paganini-like writing in the score sounds when performed as sparkling, ethereal sounds.<br /><br />His 1998 opera &#34;Luci mie traditrici&#34; (My Treacherous Eyes, sometimes retitled &#34;Killing Flower&#34;) applies that style to vocal writing with remarkable effect. The simple plot is inspired by the story of Gesualdo, the Renaissance composer who discovered that his wife was cheating on him, and then murdered her and her lover in bed, his aristocratic rank protecting him from prosecution. Hearing that Alfred Schnittke was preparing an opera on the same theme, Sciarrino deleted overt references to Gesualdo (and quotations of Gesualdo's music), and he chose to adapt 17th-century playwright Giacinto Andrea Cicognini's own retelling of Gesualdo under the title &#34;Il tradimento per l'onore&#34;.<br /><br />As the opera opens, a Dutchess (soprano, here Nina Tarandek) and Duke (baritone, Christian Miedl) pledge eternal love to each other. Soon, however, the Dutchess is seduced by a Guest (counter-tenor, Roland Schneider), and the tryst is reported to the Duke by a Servant (tenor, Simon Bode). Thus ends the first act. In the second, the Duke prepares the murder of the Guest and then his wife, at which this hour-long staging comes to a sudden end.<br /><br />The vocal writing is eerie, lines thrown out scattershot, long-held notes at the beginning collapsing into a series of grace notes. The ensemble of 22 players (winds, strings and bass drum) produces Sciarrino's characteristic soundworld of skittering, noctural sounds. While avant-garde, the musical accompaniment is not noisy or abstract, instead it seems to depict the unspoken thoughts of the characters. As a prologue to the opera, we hear a snippet of pure Renaissance-era music, and later in the opera this same material is heard transformed through Sciarrino's extended techniques. The action is stylized, with for example the Dutchess and Guest's tryst expressed only through repetition of suggestive lines and pregnant pauses. The austere and ritualistic proceedings remind this viewer of drama from some non-Western culture, such as kabuki.<br /><br />In this DVD, Marco Angius leads the Ensemble Algoritmo in a July 2010 production. How does this stack up against other recordings? This seems to be the same performance as captured on a 2011 [[ASIN:B0050JPFMO Stradivarius disc]]. There is an [[ASIN:B00013D4OK earlier Stradivarius disc]] where the Ensemble Risognanze performs, but I have not heard that yet. I am familiar with the Klangforum Wien/Beat Furrer performance [[ASIN:B00005JSJH on Kairos]], and that is somewhat superior in terms of sound (the ensemble being more prominent in the mix). However, the Algoritmo/Angius production is deftly performed and Sciarrino himself calls it definitive.<br /><br />While its nice to have at least some visuals, I am not entirely happy with this DVD. It's bad enough that this was released solely in DVD instead of Blu-ray, but even the DVD transfer is flawed: with artifacts visible in near every shot. Was this shot for television broadcast and then re-encoded for DVD? The DVD does come with a bonus where the singers, Angius and the Ensemble Algoritmo rehearsing the piece and discuss how they approach Scarrino's music.<br /><br />So while I would consider &#34;Luci mie traditrici&#34; a four-star affair (impressive, though not among the greatest operas I've ever seen), that poor quality of the visuals leads me to dock a star. I'm sorry I have to do that, since I suppose we should be grateful we get avideo of this avant-garde opera at all.

If you're a guy, you will likely max out on shrugs and benching these, but if you just do more reps, they will still keep you healthy.  And after all, who really wants to have to turn sideways when walking through doorways (due to having such large muscles).  Actually, I had a friend in college who said that was his goal.

10759	__label2__	5	N	Video Games	B002BSA20M	Halo Reach	The Best Shooter	Halo Reach is up there with Modern Warfare 2 and Battlefield 3 as the best shooter of the xbox 360 generation.<br /><br />This is simply an incredible game. The graphics are grittier. The gameplay is tighter. Gone is the too-obvious auto-aim in Halo 3. The Flood does not exist at all. The Elites are not superfriends, but are a vicious enemy.<br /><br />There is more the reality that the SPARTAN soldiers are really distrusted by many humans.<br /><br />Where Halo 3 felt like an xbox 1 game with some next-gen graphic features tacked on, Halo Reach truly feels next-gen. The lighting is better, everything is crisper, it is simply a superior game.<br /><br />What makes this game great for me is that it is sci-fi, and yet it feels so real. The SPARTAN soldiers are otherworldly, yet some of the early game locales feel like isolated farming hamlets not too different from Earth. Early on, I got the sense that the SPARTAN team was reminiscent of Latin American death squads, which at least is somewhat more realistic of groups of men with guns who maraud across the countryside. If you know anything about the game's fiction, if not for the Covenant invasion, that is pretty much what the SPARTAN soldiers would have been: fascist stormtroopers taking out high-value targets of the human opposition, because the lumbering government refused to negotiate.<br /><br />But then the Covenant arrive and that gives them the opportunity to unite against a common enemy and be heroes.<br /><br />Because this is, after all, a video game.<br /><br />Still, I appreciated that early part. I really like this game.

This was the nicest looking one at the store, and without examining the box closely, it IMPLIED that it is programmable.<br /><br />But it is not what I would call "programmable".  You can select from only 4 settings:<br />- High for 4 hours<br />- High for 6 hours<br />- Low for 8 hours<br />- Low for 10 hours<br /><br />That doesn't do me much good when I need to cook a recipe on Low for 4 hours.  I will have to be home at the end of the four hours to manually turn it off or switch to warm.<br /><br />I wish I had discovered this before I put food in it.  I would've taken it right back to the store, and ordered a REAL programmable slow cooker from Amazon.  Now I'm stuck with it.  :-(
10761	__label2__	4	N	Video DVD	B001AD8FT4	Man From Cheyenne	Rounding Up Rustlers	The Man From Cheyenne, 1942 film<br /><br />Cattle graze, men on horses ride up and shoot their pistols to drive them into a cave. "About two hundred." They are placed on trucks and driven away. The "Wyoming Cattlemens Association" hold a meeting on this theft. An alarm sounds outside, there is a robbery. A man shoots at the fleeing automobile. "Nice shooting." The man from the Department of Commerce has a job for him. Roy grew up in that area and would not be suspicious. Cowboys sing as they ride, they meet Roy. Roy meets Judy next. Gabby complains about cattle thefts. There is a meeting of the ranch owners. They want to pool resources and coordinate their activities. One horse threw a shoe. Gabby rides with Roy and Judy.<br /><br />Miriam gives a party on Saturday night. There is music and dancing. [There is comedy.] Then a song. The rustlers struck again! Where did they go? Jim caught one of them, he's one of Miriam's crew. They will take care of Jim and get rid of his horse too. The next morning they notice Jim's absence. When his body is found Roy finds sand in one boot. [Trace evidence.] Roy finds that hidden cave, and Bob finds him. A shot misses them! Roy rides after the shooter and captures him. "He's one of the Hardy men." But Roy is seen near that tunnel! Roy talks to Miriam about the rustlers. He tests her and she fails! The shooting begins, Roy is trapped in the ranch house. Help arrives just in time. Judy and Miriam struggle. Will Roy stay or move on? And so it ends. [No mention of the trials and sentencing.]<br /><br />This is an interesting story about rustling done at one of the cattle ranches. Did this reflect war-time fears about a "fifth column"? My copy had low contrast washed-out video. Some of these movies were cut back to 53 minutes to fit into an hour of TV with advertising.

10763	__label2__	5	N	Books	1612183123	Trail of Dead (Scarlett Bernard)	Great Characters, Excellent Story	Trail of Dead is the second Scarlett Bernard Novel.  I read and reviewed the first novel, Dead Spots, in October of 2012.<br /><br />Sometimes a second book is a let down.  That is not true of Trail of Dead.  If anything it is even better that Dead Spots.  One of the things that struck me this time was how two different authors can take the same premise and write books that are completely different.  In the Alexia Tarabotti novels by Gail Carriger Alexia can negate supernatural powers or when near vampires and werewolves they become normal humans.  Scarlett does the same but the stories and characters are completely different.  The fact that it took me two books to even make the comparison is proof of that.<br /><br />The world building was done in Dead Spots.  The main characters are the same. Jesse, Scarlett and Eli are all part of the story but the focus has moved from Jesse and Eli to Scarlett.  Trail of Dead builds from the foundation laid in Dead Spots.  Again the writing is excellent, the plot well developed, the characters well drawn and tension builds to a satisfying conclusion.  Again, there were some unexpected twists and turns.  This book was based on a problem character from book one.  That character is now gone.  Trail of Dead could be the last Scarlett Bernard Novel but I am hoping that I saw a small set up for the next book.  I will certainly be on the look out and hoping that the series will continue.<br /><br />Trail of Dead is scheduled for publication June 4, 2013.  I received an advanced reader's copy review copy of Trail of Dead from Amazon Vine.  You should pre-order your copy now.

10766	__label2__	3	N	Toys	B00CI6J3QG	Crayola Dry Erase Light-Up Board	It Is Okay	First, you must know, my kids are artists. They like high end art supplies. They draw, color, sculpt, and create all the time. This is just added novelty to their already artful day.<br /><br />Now, the batteries (3 AA, not included) are almost impossible to put in. It was a great circus act to see my husband try to get them all in their proper place and get the cover back on before they sprung in different directions. It took him an embarrassing amount of tries to get them in properly. They just want to pop straight back out.<br /><br />The black/white board and the top clear plastic board slide in and out of the frame. [[ASIN:B00CI6JDGQ Crayola Widescreen Light Designer]] does not do that, it has a fixed board, which is preferred. Yes, the slide out boards give you the option of white or black background, but the white is extremely difficult to see.<br /><br />This board comes with dry erase crayons. If you've ever worked with those, you know they leave a waxy residue on the board. You'll need to clean that off after their daily use. Not between every drawing, but before they put it away for the day. I recommend washing it in dish soap- it cuts the waxy build up quickly and easily. These crayons are also ridiculously messy. They write on skin. They smear off onto skin. They are difficult to remove from the cloth of your tan sofa. (Doh!) Just be aware of that and plan play accordingly.<br /><br />This board comes with a wipe off cloth. Unlike other reviewers, my children had no problem using the cloth. It was pretty easy for them. I do have to wash the plastic board when they're done so that they can happily play the next day. But they can clean between drawings effectively.<br /><br />This one does not look as good as [[ASIN:B00CI6JDGQ Crayola Widescreen Light Designer]]. The drawings do glow, but they aren't as sharp as the widescreen version. They clear plate over the black one with the open frame just doesn't hold the light quite the same. If you're torn between the two, buy the widescreen. It is much better overall.

I don't wash my hair every day so I used these tubes for 7 consecutive washes.  I didn't notice much difference during the first 5 tubes, in fact, my hair felt heavy and with some residue.  My hair is wavy but med/thin and it weighs down easily.  By the 6th and 7th tubes, I notice my hair was a bit bouncier and the frizz control had improved.  I didn't see a dramatic change, like super silky or shiny, but I did notice the almost no frizz - and we have had rainy days, so I know it helped.<br /><br />My hair is brown with some highlights.  This treatment didn't make the highlights dull or fade away (like other heavy treatments have done).  I didn't use a special shampoo, just used this treatment instead of conditioner (with longer waiting time).  I didn't use any other styling products either.  Each tube has plenty of `cream' and I wonder if a person with short hair would be able to use half the tube at a time.  My hair is about 3" below my shoulders now, and I could've used 2/3 of the tube and have plenty.<br /><br />Overall, the 7 'day' treatment improved my hair but didn't change it dramatically.

I have had good success with Panasonic video cameras in the past though primarily rely on a Sony Handycam HDR-CX160 these days which is more than twice the price with a 40x1 zoom.  This camera is a great value but it is very, very lightweight and not overly rugged so this would be for a mature or experienced user as it isn’t as sturdy as many in its class and isn’t going to take being knocked around.  However, it will slip in your pocket without you hardly noticing it’s there.  That being said, it operates well, the zoom is great though you will need a mini-tripod or monopod to keep your long distance subject in focus.

It is pretty sturdy for a plastic funnel. The top diameter measures just under 5 inches. The funnel is 1 1/4 (1 and 2/8) inches across on the inside, and about 1 5/8 on the outside. So this means that the plastic thickness adds 3/8 inches to whatever it fits INTO.    I was tired of funnels that get so skinny at the end. I have a hard time getting powder through those. And the ultra-wide canning funnels don't fit into the jars I have because they are too big. So this funnel is incredibly handy--kind of an in-between compromise between a regular funnel and a canning funnel.    Recommended, nice product!  *****

10784	__label2__	5	Y	Video DVD	B0060ZJ74O	Moneyball (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy) [Blu-ray]	Oakland A's - The Baseball Team With A Heart	I love the Oakland A's & the story of Billy Bean & how he managed & still manages the A's Baseball team.  If you love baseball, or statistics & math & gambling type of thinking, then you will love this movie.  It also has a lot of heart & is a true story of a great manager & team.  I love Oakland A's & SF Giants Bruce Bochy. I want more movies about great managers like Bruce Bochy & Billy Bean.  Oh, & Brad Pitt does a great job of playing his character.<br />This is a great movie to own on the collection shelf & is very unique from any other managing style or movie. I LOVE this movie!!
10785	__label2__	5	Y	Grocery	B005LXGBUE	Bakto Flavors Natural Lavender Flavor-4 OZ	what I was looking for	The lavender flavor is very strong- a little goes a long way. Really adds that unusual taste. Honey-lavender icecream...need I say more?
10786	__label2__	5	Y	Outdoors	B000RYWQP6	ZODI Outback Gear Extreme SC Hot Shower	Very happy with this purchase	Very happy with this purchase.  I bought this to use at my remote hunting cabin and it worked perfectly.  The water does take some time to heat up but it does warm up nicely.  I purchased one of those propane hose adapters so I could use a 20 lb propane tank instead of the small propane cylinders, but the small cylinders do work, just not sure how many uses you'd get from the small cylinders.  After heating the water I followed the directions and pumped up the tank to build internal pressure.  Once this was done the shower head/hose supplied an excellent flow ofwater with which to shower with.  This thing worked fantastic, I love it.  It's very nicely built, fits nicely into it's carrying case when not in use and functions fantastic.  Great item, I would definitely recommend this item.
10787	__label2__	5	N	Kitchen	B00GJAU62W	KitchenAid KCH108TPKD Hard Anodized Nonstick 8" and 10" Skillets Twin Pack Cookware - Black Diamond	The good kind	These skillets are the real deal; sturdy, even-heating, nonstick, even with comfortable handles. They have a satisfying heft and a heavy bottom designed to work well with my induction burner. They also fit my other cooker base perfectly, and i already have lids that fit, though anyone without the usual excess of lids can grab some at Goodwill or on Amazon. Though the newer nonsticks are stronger than the old kind, I still plan to use my bamboo and silicone utensils to make them last. I shouldn't ever need to replace these.

Its simple to setup and easy to store til turkey season, when it will really test its effectiveness.  I'll update my review when season hits. Update: April 2015 we took this on a recent trip to hunt in North Georgia.  This decoy is simple to setup, lightweight and it held up very well throughout the weekend even during several heavy rain storms.  This should last for my seasons

My wife loves her Keurig, and loves to use her own coffee so I thought this would be perfect for her. Well, boy was I wrong. First, I should note that our Keurig came with an adapter that she uses to make her coffee using the grounds she likes. This saves money, is more environmentally kind and yields a better cup of coffee! Using the Melitta Javajig yielded a weak, ground filled cup of coffee. Since you still have clean up/rinsing afterwards, you don't even save time. This is what she uses: http://www.amazon.com/Keurig-Replacement-Coffee-Filter-pieces/dp/B009VIUI04/ref=pd_sbs_k_2 and she is very happy, as I mentioned, it came with the unit we bought (a couple of years ago). There is no need to waste money, paper, etc.! For my wife to tell me to give it one star says a lot, folks.

After that night I searched for this movie on amazon. I'm happy I have both movies now. This is a funny and cute movie to watch.

For my money, its the best on the market. That said, the stock they're selling here is very poor.<br /><br />I ordered a few different sizes and both orders had issues. When I got the first order, I immediately noticed the manufacturers box had water damage and was ripped apart. As a result, the cans basically fell out in transit and were rolling around in the Amazon box. All were heavily dented and some had rust on them for some reason.<br /><br />As for the second order, the cans and box were in better shape (still some dents), but the expiration date was just 2 weeks away. I have to say, I really ate that I got practically expired products.<br /><br />In the end, I was very disappointed with both orders and wont order Blue Monkey via Amazon any longer.
10795	__label2__	5	Y	Kitchen	B0086UR0UO	Excelsteel Cook Pro Inc Salad Spinner, 4-1/2-Quart	Don't know how I lived without it!	I love this salad spinner! I read A LOT of reviews about different spinners. Some talked about cords breaking and the basket being to small. This spinner is PERFECT!! This can hold most of a &#34;head&#34; of green leaf lettuce. That's the only type of lettuce we eat, so I don't know how much it will hold of Iceberg. I would say that this could provide enough lettuce for four good size salads. Maybe more. I love this thing. Definitely recommend it!!!!!!!
10796	__label2__	5	Y	Baby	B002M77N22	Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow (Discontinued by Manufacturer)	Great for home, travel, etc.	Best product I ever bought for my children.  My first born had colic and he rarely slept during the day and at night he wanted to be propped up.  He did not like to lay flat ever.  I read about this product and decided to give it a try it was perfect.  I didn't have to put him on his stomach or put a wedge in his crib which made me nervous.  This allowed me to put him on his back and be tilted.  I was able to put this next to my bed so I could rock him gently back to sleep after feedings.  Its light and folds so its easy to move from room to room.  My second child thankfully did not have colic but this worked great b/c he always wanted me in his sight so I could move this around and it kept him off the floor and away from his big brother.
10797	__label2__	5	Y	Toys	B0084M8UE4	Survive Escape From Atlantis 30th Anniversary Edition	A great family game (especially for aggressive players) that will bring the smiles to kids' faces!	This is a great family game to play, as long as you don't have any sore losers in your family or gaming group. This game is half offense and half defense. As long as everyone is just out for themselves, this game is a lot of fun. If one person is ganged up on or if "teams" are formed, things can get a little ugly.<br /><br />The premise of the game is already described pretty well in the publisher's product description, so I won't go into that any further. What I will say is that the game can be taught to play in about two minutes, and anyone aged 5 or older will be able to play it without any trouble. This game has a fun theme and is very light in terms of concepts and rules, making it an easy entry-level game for anyone who isn't accustomed to "designer" games. Play time for the game is around 30 minutes if four people are playing, but shorter is fewer are playing. If you want to expand the game's number of players to five or six, there is an expansion available ([[ASIN:B005FPEWCC Survive 5-6 Player expansion]]) that must be purchased separately. This game was out of print for quite a long time but is finally available, again, along with a few mini-expansions, including [[ASIN:B004LE0W1S Survive: Escape From Atlantis - The Giant Squid Mini-Expansion]] and [[ASIN:B00CA2B0V4 Survive: Dolphins and Dive Dice Mini-Expansion]]. I have no idea how long this print run will be available, so it may be a good idea to purchase this while you can get it!<br /><br />Survive is a fun little game that most any kids or adults will enjoy playing, and they will probably want to play it more than once - especially if the scores are close! I highly recommend this to all families!

We've used other brands of canned clams before for similar purposes. This time we decided to try Bumble Bee. We were glad we did. The taste and texture of the Bumble Bee clams is definitely superior. And the juice in which they come is rich and tasty. The clams are finally chopped, which is what one wants in a minced-clam recipe. From now on we plan on buying the Bumble Bee brand.

10801	__label2__	3	N	Kitchen	B001CUMLOK	ZeroWater ZD-013 8-Cup Pitcher	Don't buy this one unless you're one of two categories	I wasn't sure what I thought about Zero Water, but I have been a Brita and Pur user for years. I'm always interested in trying different water filtration technologies and seeing how they taste. Conclusions with this one:<br /><br />1.  It does produce water that tests as no particles / dissolved solids<br />2.  It doesn't filter out some things that the other two big brands do. Certain bacteria, cryposporidium, etc. This is declared on the package insert.<br />3.  The water it produces may feel better, but may or may not taste better.<br /><br />It clearly changes the water. The filter itself is about 2-3 times the size/volume of a Pur or Brita. The water feels more wet in my mouth. I like this. What I don't like is that the water it produces for me doesn't taste as good as what I get out of Pur (which is what I'm currently using). I do like the feel better, and it makes more clear ice cubes, so I am going to (gulp) use them together. First the PUR, then this one.<br /><br />And now for why you shouldn't buy this one unless you're one of two people.  This pitcher is poorly designed. The lid barely stays on and doesn't lip down over the edges to prevent spills when the top filler area has water in it-- for example, refilling to the line and taking it back to the fridge.  The flip lip that opens when you pour is terribly thin. The edges of the plastic were sharp and not polished. The only positive about this pitcher is that the handle is designed very sturdily. That being said, if you need an 8 cup instead of 10 because you absolutely can't fit a 10 cup, this model might be for you.<br /><br />The other person who might want this one is someone who doesn't care about the tester. This one has an analog result tester: Light on means bad results, light off means good results. Or the device might just not be testing at all.... I didn't like that. The model that does 10 cups, and comes with the digital tester is only $2 more!<br /><br />If you have enough space for the 10cup, and you'd prefer a digital tester rather than a cheap analog one, go for the 10 cup model.

It's a bit much for the watch I purchased it for, some I'm going to have to wait until I have a watch with a simpler dial and 18mm lug width to use it.
10805	__label2__	3	N	Sports	B0066Q4GSO	Callaway Hex Chrome White Golf Ball, 12-Pack	No better than similarly priced balls; in fact worse in some ways	I only golf 2-3 times a year, when I visit my father in Pinehurst.  My Dad, though, plays almost daily, so I brought these 3 balls with me on my last visit, and we both gave them a try.<br /><br />For me, I couldn't see any difference between these Callaways and the Callaways my father regularly uses (hex black).  I'm not very good no matter what ball I'm playing with!  But my father felt that the hex chromes were tooo soft; they are supposed to have a 'soft feel' but these, he says, are more mushy.<br /><br />Bottom Line: A mediocre golfer's game is not improved with the hex chrome, a strong golfer may find them too soft.  My father did point out that a golfer with more experience than I have (who is therefore more discerning), but who has a weaker swing than he does (maybe a woman golfer) might enjoy these balls.

It works, it's rugged, and Berkley makes a wide range of reliable tackle and gear.<br /><br />It definitely pays to comparison shop online versus your local retail. Prices on Amazon fluctuate wildly, and everything dips down into bargain territory if you're patient. No need to overpay online.<br /><br />Hope this is helpful. Good fishing and 'tight lines', everybody.

10809	__label2__	5	N	Office Products	B00FX51LA0	Wilson Jones Ultra Duty Round Ring View Binder with Extra Durable Hinge, 1.5 Inch, Customizable, White (W87905PP2)	Easy Open/Close and Secure Closure Rings	There are times that you have a binder that gets a lot of use. And there are times that a binder is just an organizational storage container. This is a great binder for heavy use and quick access. It does not have a super heavy duty cover, in fact I'm not sure it is much different than the basic binders. But the spine and rings are great. They are O-rings with a silicone covered single push tab that pops them open. They are double locked where they meet with a little pin that sinks inside the other side for added security. And the cover and spines allow for sheets to be slipped inside.<br /><br />This size is great for meeting notes, project organization, etc. and is easy to carry.<br /><br />The inside covers have deep, clear pockets for slipping a page or two but not much more. I think this is good as an ultra duty binder because it has such a great O-ring set-up. Easy open close and secure closure.
10810	__label2__	3	N	PC	B00C8OT7FK	Belkin QODE Slim Style Keyboard and Case for iPad Air (Black)	Exterior good, flimsy interior bands, no auto wake/sleep	Even though Belkin did a great job with a super thin and wide spaced keyboard with a Surface style stand, there is still scope of improvement in this product.<br /><br />Style and Design: Very elegant and classy looks. Well designed with all ports and connections easily accessible.<br /><br />Weight : 17.2 oz (1.075 lbs) slightly heavier than the iPad Air itself.<br /><br />Keyboard: Very thin and keys are designed to type faster. Some keys are oddly placed like &#34;/&#34; has to be used with shift, &#34;:&#34; is next to the space bar, and back arrow is placed close to pair button. I guess this will take some time to get used to.<br /><br />Smart function: Entirely missing. It does not automatically sleeps and wake your iPad. You have to do it manually.<br /><br />IPad Enlsosure: The interior side to hold iPad is a bit flimsy and not good quality as expected from the overall product. Its held by mere elastic bands.<br /><br />Exterior Surface: Good looks, can be wiped clean easily.<br /><br />Positions: Three standing positions in horizontal orientation. The keyboard cover can be fully folded into the back for reading in vertical orientation. However, it is a bit convenient due to more than twice the weight from iPad Air itself and hence not suited for long time reading.<br /><br />Overall, it is a good companion for typing and writing and may provide good value for money at about 50 bucks.
10811	__label2__	2	Y	Video Games	B002I0J8KS	The Fight: Lights Out - Playstation 3	The Reviewers are right on this title	Yes, as others have noted this game it is a little gimped at first because it is an RPG and you can improve your fighter's statistics.  However, the decision to make this an RPG was pretty stupid. To "level up" you have to perform stupid exercises, and then distribute stat points. IT's more RPG than Mass Effect 2.   OTherwise, yes it is an interesting take, but it seriously should have been more an arcade game.

This is a good designed tool that is manufactured in China. I really like the spring on the pliers. You will hate the pouch. Always hangs up. If you can only have one tool would I recommend this over a Leatherman? No it's not the Leatherman made in USA quality. Leatherman and Gerber both have outstanding warranties, you will be more likely to need the Gerbers in my experience.<br />This tool feels good in your hand, and it's the best Gerber multi tool ever. My older Gerber multi tool got so loose and then when I pulled it from the pouch after not using for awhile had serious rust and I just shook my head and trashed it. Their newer tools are much better thankfully, but that looseness possibility still concerns me. The one thing to check in comparing tools side by side is the machining of the Phillips head screwdrivers. In that attention to detail regard Leatherman and Sog still better the Gerber.

10814	__label2__	5	N	Outdoors	B0009PUR72	Coleman 12 Ounce Enamelware Coffee Mug (Blue)	Great Old Time Mug	I have owned a number of these Coleman mugs for years. In fact I have one that is over 12 years old that went on every hike I ventured on over those dozen years.  (It has since been retied and enjoying the good life on a shelf).  These mugs are not the kind that will appeal to everyone for sure.  You have to have a real nostalgia thing going to enjoy it them, or just like the feel of it over an open fire on a cold morning or evening.  Sure the handle gets hot if the coffee is really steaming, but it dissipates quickly if used outdoors where it has always been in service with me.  The number of times I have used it at home over the fire place the hot handle has never bothered me since I don't get the coffee as hot as over a campfire.<br /><br />As to some of the other more critical reviews of this about it chipping and peeling, I think one of the fallacies about old time enamel mugs like these is that they are prit' near indestructible which is not true.  Just because they are made of metal you can't toss them on a pile of rocks or expose them to all manner of rough weather.  I've always treated mine like they are made of out glass and done just fine with them.  No doubt some of the reviewers here that had their mugs peel and whatnot were as careful as I am and still saw their mugs fail or fall apart way too fast.  All I can tell you is that the number I have owned have held up well for me and I have never had a problem with them.  Altogether a rugged, well made old time mug at a good price that I highly recommend... : )

10817	__label2__	5	N	Baby	B00HAZSBIG	Munchkin Bath Fun Bubble Blower Toy	Redesign seems to have done the trick...	My toy arrived and I admit I had some frustration getting it out of the packaging, this little bird was tied in TIGHT.  I'm glad I didn't alert my little one that it had arrived because he would have had to wait a LONG time for me to first get the thing out of the packaging and then try to get the battery cover off to get the batteries in.    Once I had achieved that herculean task though, operation couldn't have been more smooth.  There's a little button for off and on at the top of birdies' head and that's all it takes for him to start up the fun after you add the bubble solution.  You can use any type of bubble solution you like undiluted.    I found that this does actually seem to be best for the tub or barring that, outdoors because of the wetness factor.  I personally would NEVER use this indoors except in the tub.  It does tend to get wet underneath and around the unit, so if that is going to be an issue just place it on top of a towel or something like that.  Really - I think that is why this is labeled as a "tub toy" primarily.    It works well and delights children.  I had no issues with the operation of it.  Especially boisterous youngsters may accidentally knock this over if using this outside without aid of the suction cup.... so supervision might be in order.    EDIT 2-17-15 Still working well on original set of batteries.   I do note that if you don't empty out the bubble stuff each time or run it out that it will leak out.   We have just taken to leaving this permanently in the bathroom tub on the ledge so it's not that big a deal but worth noting if you want to conserve your bubbles or think you might be returning to "use them later".   I also note that when we switched bubble brands to a cheaper one we can't use it continually for more than five minutes at a time.... we have to let the bird "rest" because the bubbles get too thick and sudzy and it can't spit them out as well.   So if we turn it off for a few minutes then turn it on again that seemsto do the trick.  We could go back to using the more expensive bubbles.... but since our system works and our 4 year old seems ok with our explanation of the bird needing to "rest" it doesn't seem to pressing to pay more money.

They are semi soft and quite crumbly. In fact most of the ones in my bag were broken. The dogs seemed to enjoy them and they suffered no ill effects. The bag is resealable which is convenient and helpful when transporting. It was hard to tell how many were in the bag since most were crumbled. They are free of corn, wheat, artificial flavors or preservatives.<br /><br />There were no guidelines for feeding other than to break into pieces for a small dog. I wasn't crazy to see that they contained both sugar (sucrose) and salt. Plus this company does not provide easily accessible information about where the ingredients are sourced. You will not find it on the website or the package. You must call Customer Service. They keep a list of the origins of the proteins but not all the ingredients. They will tell you that they do use supplements, mainly folic acid, from China.So while the dogs like them,  I will stick to treats made in sourced from the US like [[ASIN:B001FKC8W2 Stewart Beef Liver Freeze Dried (2oz)] or ones I make myself.

10821	__label2__	5	Y	Electronics	B009OBCAW2	HomeSpot NFC-Enabled Bluetooth Audio Receiver for Sound System	Great device for Bluetooth audio!	Given the high rating of this device on Amazon, I decided to give it a try so I could add Bluetooth capabilities to a mini-system that I keep in the kitchen.  Since buying it, I've been transporting it between other systems in the house.<br /><br />Audio quality seems to be pretty good--not as good as a direct connection, but this is all about convenience.  What really shines is its ability to easily pair with other devices.  I find this receiver with no problems using the Bluetooth built into my laptop.  But with my phone, all I need to do is tap the top of this device with my phone; the phone then enables its own Bluetooth connection, and pairs automatically.  (The magic of NFC, aka near-field communications.)<br /><br />With such easy pairing, and good sound quality, I can't rate this any less than five stars.  It has worked flawlessly for me in the time that I've owned it, and plan on buying at least two more of these in the near future.

All of them come across to me as being well made, and none of them seem like they are overpriced.  Prior to trying these, I've owned a [[ASIN:B000I618NY Wagner 905]] for over four years.  The video shows the three McCulloch cleaners side by side, shows the included accessories, and discusses the individual cleaners a bit (sorry it's so long, but there's an outline at the front that shows when each segment is).<br /><br />I admit that I had high hopes about this model (and the slightly less expensive 1375) before they arrived because they are higher pressure cleaners than the Wagner.  I bought the Wagner to help clean grout in my new tile, but it never did a very good job with it.  I thought the added pressure might be the added boost that I needed.  To cut to the chase - it wasn't.  I might be using these wrong, but they just don't seem to get the grout any cleaner than a wet cloth does.  So, a disappointment for me on the grout, but I still recommend it if you're looking for a steam cleaner for the following reasons.<br /><br />Pros and why I like it:<br />(*) The steam mop attachment on this (and it's the same on the 1375) is fantastic!  Soooo much better and quieter than the one I've been using on the Wagner.  I think McCulloch did a great job with that.  I'm particularly aware of it because that all I really use the Wagner for anymore, and this model was just an overall better experience. I had stopped using the Wagner and had switched to a regular mop, but I believe that I'll switch back to steaming.  This and the 1385 are just so easy to use, and the tiles seem really clean afterwards<br />(*) The hole to pour water into is in a recessed area, so you don't have to use a funnel or have perfect aim to avoid a mess.  The shape of the opening serves as its own funnel.  I love that!  It's a big improvement over the Wagner model that I own<br />(*) Well made.  All of the accessories feel solid and fit well, and the main unit also seems solid<br />(*) Long power cord<br />(*) Long extension steam hose<br />(*) Really good set of included accessories, including a window squeegee and some extra spares not included with the 1375<br />(*) Fairly high pressure steam with an analog dial showing the pressure<br />(*) Comfortable handle and trigger<br />(*) Ability to adjust the steam flow with a dial right on the handle by the trigger<br />(*) Can wrap up the power cord like on a vacuum cleaner<br />(*) Extendable handle let's you easily roll it around like one of those roller carry-on luggage bags<br /><br />While it didn't help me with the specific problem (dirty grout) that I was hoping it would, it does a really nice job steam mopping my tile, and it's well made with a good set of accessories.  It's an enormous step up from the Wagner that I bought years ago, that's for sure.  This is the most expensive of the three McCullochs that I tried, and about twice as expensive as the Wagner that I've had for years, but I think it's the best value out of the lot.  The added convenience features, higher pressure steam, and good set of accessories put it at the top.  Recommended.
10823	__label2__	1	N	Video DVD	B0018ATR2S	The Tale of Despereaux	Butchers of books!	What did they do?!  The book is absolutely adorable and I was looking forward to the movie.  The 2 are so different I question where the screenwriters got their information and what they were doing when they wrote it.  I watched the movie with a confused and empty feeling as I watched them butcher a perfectly good story.  The book was read by all the kids in my daughter's school and they then had a family movie night.  All of the parents got up wondering what they had just watched.

I've been very impressed with Tattle Tea in the past, and though I'm more of a Green Tea or Oolong kinda gal, I gave the English Breakfast Black Tea a try and was IN LOVE.<br /><br />The tea is great quality (not just little bits and pieces but legit loose leaf), smells amazing and tastes delicious. Very smooth and though the bag makes it seem like it's absurdly strong, it's the strength you'd expect from an English Breakfast Black Tea.<br /><br />I'll definitely be buying more Tattle Tea in the future!
10826	__label2__	5	Y	Luggage	B00HHBR008	TravelWise Packing Cube System - Durable 5 Piece Weekender Plus Set [2014 Version] (Teal)	Magically makes the capacity of your suitcase increase	I'd never previously used anything other than plastic bags to contain things in my suitcase.  I saw discussions online about how packing cubes really help consolidate your items to make room for more stuff.  So I thought I'd try the Travelwise Cube System.  I just got back from a six-day trip, and I have to say that I am very favorably impressed with the quality and performance of these cubes.  I got waaay more into a carry-on size suitcase than I would have previously believed possible.  I just rolled my clothes, and put them into a cube, stacked in a row just like pencils in a box.  And surprisingly, this method did not result in the clothes coming out badly wrinkled.<br /><br />These cubes are extremely well-made.  The seams and the zippers appear to be quite strong, and the materials are high quality.<br /><br />Definitely recommended!<br /><br />(Bonus:  TSA can see exactly what's inside the cube, so your clothes don't get rummaged through during security checks.)

10828	__label2__	5	N	Electronics	B00JSPCQXM	Pioneer SE-MX7-K Headphone, Matte Black	Combine very good audio quality and comfortable design	[[VIDEOID:mo154JOVRZUKSIM]]I was impressed with the comfort and audio quality of the Pioneer SE-MX7-K headphones. The ear cushions are supple and comfortable, even for wearing for extended periods. I acknowledge that I'm not a hardcore audiophile, but I've been listening to music since 78-rpm phonograph records were the primary media, so I do have some idea what good audio sounds like. I ran through one of my favorite playlists, and the music sounded as good or better than with any of the headphones that I've used. Vocals had excellent clarity, and the range of sound was very good with rich trebles and deep, but not overpowering, bass. One feature that I haven't seen on any headphones that I've used is the bass level control, a rotating dial on the left headphone. To my ears, it had a small but noticeable effect on the bass level, but my preference was to leave it in the default position.<br /><br />Two of the songs that I use to check out headphones and speakers are Annie Lennox's "Love Song For A Vampire" (listen for the heartbeat in the background) and The Surfaris' "Wipe Out" with drummer Ron Wilson's continuous drum riff. Both sounded great with the MX7 headphones. I also played a couple of stereo setup utilities ("Channel Balance Test" and "Stepped Stereo Pan Test"), and the headphones passed with flying colors.<br /><br />The headphones are very comfortable to wear for extended periods. I wore them for a hour on two occasions while evaluating them. The adjustable headbands allowed a good fit, and the thick ear cushions were comfortable. Both headbands will extend up to 1½", and the earcups will rotate about 15 degrees horizontally for the most comfortable fit.<br /><br />The headphone kit includes a 52" cable with an inline microphone (for using with a smartphone) and 3.5mm plugs. The plug that fits into the headphones has a rotating locking mechanism that ensures that the plug can't work loose, a very helpful feature. The headphones and cable fit nicely ina zippered soft case.<br /><br />In my opinion, the Pioneer SE-MX7-K headphones are premium-quality headphones that combine exceptional audio quality and comfortable design to give a very pleasurable listening experience.

10830	__label2__	4	Y	Luggage	B004EZG9X4	EatSmart Precision Voyager Digital Luggage Scale w/ 110 lb. Capacity & SmartGrip	Easy & Compact	Not long ago I flew off to the United Kingdom to spend several weeks with my daughter and granddaughter.  Before I left I spent weeks shopping for luggage, packing & repacking, checklists in hand.  And then I read the fine print on the luggage allowances . . . .<br /><br />It used to be that you could set the suitcase on the bathroom scale, but flat scales and wheels on the suitcase have done away with all that, so five days before I was due to catch the plane I realized that I had to do something to weigh the suitcases.  Going over your allowed number of pounds by even a single pound can be quite expensive.  This [[ASIN:B004EZG9X4 EatSmart Precision Voyager Digital Luggage Scale w/ 110 lb. Capacity & SmartGrip]] was the answer!<br /><br />This is easy as pie to use:  unhook the catch, wrap the straps around the handle of your suitcase, clip the strap shut, push the on button, wait until you see zeros and then lift the piece of luggage off the floor by the handle.  The weight displays in seconds.  Since you use two hands, I had no problem with my smaller carry-on.  I did have to corral my son-in-law to weigh the larger as I am too short to get the thing off the ground.  (I could probably pack myself in that suitcase without too much discomfort LOL.)<br /><br />The directions suggest that you underpack by a pound, then stash the scale in your suitcase.  I simply threw it in my pocketbook, where it took up only a minimal amount of space.  SO much easier than messing around with the bathroom scale trying to balance the suitcase!<br /><br />Recommended
10831	__label2__	3	N	Video DVD	B00BXWIMQS	Charlie Zone	IN A FIGHT HE CAN'T WIN	Avery (Glen Gould) is a prize fighter turned street fighter/dock worker. He is hired to rescue Jan (Amanda Crew) from a smack house to return to her parents. He runs into some issues as Jan really doesn't want to be rescued at this time and there are all kinds of people looking for her and will kill anyone who gets in the way. Avery gets in deep, and stays committed as the story takes a twist.<br /><br />This is a crime/drama with some action. The characters didn't grab you. There was nothing special about the twist, in fact it made the film cliche and formulaic. Glen Gould plays a rather boring leading man. It makes for an acceptable Canadian rental at best.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex or nudity.

The controls are pretty simple once you get to know them or have played the previous SC games,the effects,audio and story are top notch kudos to Ubi Soft for the great work.<br /><br />So for fans of the series here's a incredible new release and for those just getting started into the series I say if you can start from the first game or at least from the previous game to get a feel on the relationship. and story background of some of the characters.
10833	__label2__	4	Y	Books	1595231072	Unintimidated: A Governor's Story and a Nation's Challenge	Insights Into the Man and His Methods	I will first note that I think Scott Walker is a 5 star governor based on his record as of this review.  Having said that, this is a book review - not a review of Scott Walker - so I've downscaled it to 4 stars based on the book itself.  The book discusses the challenges and controversy of passage of Act 10 in Wisconsin, as well as many other reforms instituted by Walker and the Republican majority in response to a budget crisis in 2010.  The book lags and repeats in spots, but is generally well written and easily read.  His principles and approach are well documented, and his positions as well as prescriptions are well articulated at a macro-level.  The book coveys the palpable tension of the 2011 protests and their aftermath.  As Walker begins to contemplate a run for President in 2016, it is important to be informed - and this book will give you some insights into the man and his methods.

This Avery business card stock should be called instant business cards for that it was it truly is. With a few simple steps to set up your word processor file, you can quickly produce as many or as few professional appearing business cards. The page of cards sticks together firmly and goes through the printer (well, mine anyway) without any breaking or jamming. The color sticks as cleanly as it does for any paper. And then, once you have it all printed up, just break the cards out - they come out without any ugly tabs. And voila, you have a group of high quality business cards!<br /><br />It probably sounds like I am going a bit over the top, right? Well, in fact, just recently I needed some business cards, and I was able to create a batch with this product in a matter of minutes. I was very pleased with the results, and think that this product is tops. I give it my highest recommendations!

I used a lux meter to help demonstrate the brightness of the light:    white light / bright setting = 344 lux  white light / low light setting = 162 lux    warm light / bright setting = 104 lux  warm light / low light setting = 66 lux    For comparison,  a 60 watt fluorescent light at the same distance is 1701 lux    The clip of this light is quite large, it is not something you would clip to the book as it would cover too much of the page. I found the clip a little stiff stiff and difficult to open, hopefully it will get easier as I use it.  I am using it clipped to a shelf.  My favorite feature is a nice switch on the cord that allows me to control the four light modes.  The neck is flexible and holds its position well.  It comes with a cord and USB adapter.    This clip light is provided by Mudder.    Ali Julia review

We use these bags when our milk bottles are full.<br /><br />It is easier to store than the bottles, though it meant having to pour it from the Medela bottle which my wife pumps directly into. The top of the bag is quite large so there is little spillage, and we store it in standing position.<br /><br />My wife usually breast feeds my girl so storage is not an issue though we feel that if you need to store more milk say in a freezer load, then these AVENT milk storage bags may not be as suitable due to its fairly large and bulky form.
10838	__label2__	4	N	Electronics	B00BXJZ30Y	iLuv Syren iPhone 6 NFC Compatible Bluetooth Portable Speaker (Black)	Not bad but rather overpriced	The good is that this pairs easily with most bt devices, and as a speakerphone it's quite adequate. It looks pretty nice, though this leads to...<br /><br />The not so good is that though this looks iSleek, that emphasis on looks over functionality made them stick the pause button for receiving calls on the back of the speaker. Since it's slanted, this is just silly in every way. Other negatives are that while this sounds ok for voice, for music it's merely fair, and that it's not the heavy duty construction you'd expect at this price.<br /><br />It's a decent little speaker-phone/speaker combo, but 50 is too much for this somewhat flimsy piece of plastic, however shiny. 25 to 30 is what this is really worth, I'd say. And that button on the back must give one pause, as it were, as to whether that feature will make the speakerphone aspect worth pursuing.<br /><br />Amazing how designers just don't really think things through, or place form over function so often.<br />In a world of cheap disposable crap, that crap should at least make perfect sense while it does indeed work.<br /><br />Bluetooth is still a selling point so companies are getting away with overpricing simple bt items. That can't last, nor should it.
10839	__label2__	4	N	Books	0803738552	Counting by 7s	A beautiful story - a no spoilers review	This is one of the most beautiful stories I've read in a long time. It's about a 12 year old girl named Willow who looks and acts different from typical girls her age. She's a genius but the quirks don't stop there. She gets joy out of counting by sevens and is obsessed with medical symptoms and diagnoses of diseases. After disaster strikes, Willow has to find a way to cope with the motley group of people she unexpectedly finds herself among.<br /><br />This book has all the making of a Newbery gold medalist: strong character development, a lovable and unique protagonist, a death (but it happens early so it's not a depressing book), well written prose and unexpected hilarious moments interspersed. I really enjoyed it and hope it gets at least some recognition by way of awards.<br /><br />That said, even though I think it's an excellent book, I am dubious that the target age group would enjoy it. The beginning is slow and, due to the early death, was hard to get into. There were days I didn't want to pick it up because I didn't want to read about grieving. Once I got past that, I was eager to open its pages. But I can't help but think that adolescents would not be as tenacious with their reading. Also, there aren't any heart-racing moments where the excitement peaks. This is a book to savor and to relish, not to grip with white knuckled fingers at 2am.<br /><br />But personally for me, an adult, I was enchanted by it and am glad to have read it.<br /><br />P.S I know I mentioned the death but since the product description mentions it, I didn't consider it a spoiler.

I won't post any spoilers, but it's different...yet the same as PLL. You're going to want to know who did it, but you won't be able to figure it out. The clues will keep you guessing, and the plot twists will make your heart race. You'll love some of the characters, then hate them... and then love them again.

10850	__label2__	1	N	Books	0761452915	Exiled: Memoirs of a Camel	a bit mature for children, and heavy on Islam indoctrination	I was torn on how to review this book. On one hand, the book is a page turner, but as a children's book (or at least children's reading level), it's hard not to be a page-turner... on the other hand, the references to the Q'uran and Allah were nearly on every single page. It was over the top. I do not have a problem with children being exposed to other cultures or other religions - but this was not exposure - this was non-stop praise for Allah. Each chapter opens with a quote from the Q'uran and nearly every page has either a person or a camel praising Allah. I don't know if it was put in there to try to add realism to the story, but it was so emphasized, it made itself way too obvious. It was a distraction to the story. I was interested in reading this book when I read the description because of the history of the US Camel Corps. I had never heard of this experiment in American history and was intrigued by the story. The camels were captured and sold in Egypt to the US government - so I get the names they used - many of which were the authentic names of actual camels and people involved in the Camel Corps. The camels bowing to pray to Allah was a bit much. Even without the non-stop indoctrination (seriously - nearly every page), the content was a bit intense for young readers. The book is listed as for grades 4-8. Even without addressing the all-Allah-all-the-time references, the subject matter seems to be beyond what I'd feel comfortable with even a 7th grader reading. Camels mating, camels killing each other, and the Egyptian cameleer anxious to go into town to get to the prostitutes. Seriously? I'm not sure what the editors were thinking and why they didn't rein some of this in. The story of the US Camel Corps is one that needs to be told - I just think there's a better way to tell this story to young children. When looking at the book as a whole - it's goal to tell the story to children, it fails as it is too mature and heavy on religious indoctrination - whether or not that was the intent of the author.
10851	__label2__	4	Y	Musical Instruments	B00CE0VLXO	Electro-Voice ZLX12P Two-Way Powered 12" Loudspeaker	A great utility speaker for live sound applications	I bought six of these plus an EV ZXA1 powered subwoofer and I am satisfied with my purchase so far. They've been used as a monitor rig for my much larger QSC KW system and also as a mini rig for small clubs where the speakers filled both main and monitor roles. The inboard DSP works really well to smooth out the peaks and clipping and it allows for perfect Xover free matching of subs and tops. I used a pair of these tops with a pair of QSC KW 181 subwoofers and it worked in that configuration as well. They are not exceptionally loud, but they will do small rooms pretty well and have no problem working as floor monitors. Along with one of the ZXA1 powered subwoofers I was able to fit six of these and a 12 channel mixer in a tiny Toyota Corolla for a gig at VA Beach. I even brought lights and stands and it all fit in there with no problems. I surprised some veteran musicians who at first judged my mini rig as underpowered from the looks alone, when I turned up the kick drum during soundcheck to reveal that this full range system does not lack low frequency extension (in fact the sub provided the kick drum thump we all know and love!). It really is a good sounding system that gives the venerable QSC K12 a run for the money. I hope to get many miles out of these speakers.

I was so excited to find this projector. I've been wanting to do outdoor movies with my neighbors and this is perfect! It's so easy to setup, I can easily have an outdoor movie setup and ready to go in less than 1/2 an hour. Here's my take on this projector:    INSTALLATION  Installation is super easy. Just plug in the power cord and your video device cable. There are three different ways to connect this projector to your video device (HDMI, RCA, component).  The easiest and best is HDMI. There are no cables included, so I had to go out and buy and HDMI 25 foot cable and got what I wanted. This allows me to run it from either my cable box or computer super easy and the projector can be further away than just the standard short length HDMI included with my TV. With the HDMI it's a simple plug that includes both video and audio. You could run 2 HDMI cables since there's two ports in the back of the projector. I was able to hook this up with my Comcast Xfinity cable box super quick and had TV projected in my living room super-quick. Installation couldn't be easier!    DISPLAY QUALITY  Display quality is amazing!!! It is crisp, bright, and clear. It even displays beautifully in the daylight. I was totally amazed at how great the picture quality is. The color and clarity looks just like a regular flat-screen TV.    SOUND  There are built-in speakers and they're perfect for my needs. If you want to add external speakers you can, but totally not necessary for my outdoor use with small groups of people. The sound is very crisp and clear.    3D GLASSES  This couldn't be easier. I was able to try 3D using my Comcast Xfinity tripleplay 3D channel. It is included with my standard service, I just had to contact Comcast for them to "enter the code" so I could access channel 897. I charged the glasses before use for a couple hours and watched 3D for a little over an hour with no reduction in the battery power. All you do is turn on the power on the glasses, then hit the pairing button on the glasses and it paired right away with the projector with no problems. The 3D quality was great! Comcast has on demand 3D movies, so I can't wait to take advantage of that service since I don't have a 3D blueray player (although I'm considering getting one now). You must have a 3D player if you want to watch your own 3D movies.    PROJECTOR SCREENS  I wanted a portable screen and I finally found one at Fry's in Wilsonville, Oregon manufactured by Loch. [[ASIN:B00DV1INFY LOCH 84" diagonal 4:3 Tripod Projection Screen]] I tried Best Buy and was disappointed that they didn't have any screens "in store", the guy just wanted to sell me one from their on-line store. I didn't want to buy it on-line because the shipping is so expensive and I wanted to see the quality of the screen before I made the purchase. Fry's has the Loch screen in 100" and 83". I went with the 83" model and it is perfect for indoor and outdoor use. 100" [[ASIN:B00HK23QJI Matte White 100" diagonal Portable Projector Screen]] was too big for my little, tiny living room. I also considered the Epson portable screen [[ASIN:B000HRYV38 Epson Duet 80-Inch Dual Aspect Ratio Projection Screen]]. You can also project on the wall...I did in my computer room and it was so cool....read on...    COMPUTER HOOKUP  Just like the cable box, it was super easy to connect to my HP Envy laptop through the HDMI cable. The only problem I had was I had previously put it in 3D mode and didn't realize I had to take it out of 3D even after unplugging the projector. I can surf the web, watch YouTube videos, and show my huge library of photos on my wall. Even work on Word and Excel documents in super-large format...this is like having a HUGE COMPUTER MONITOR.    TECHNICAL SUPPORT  I had to call Epson tech support when I couldn't get my laptop display to show up. It's funny, their tech support looks like you're calling Long Beach California, but the tech support is actually routed through the Philippines. The technician spoke very good english, was courteous, and helpful.    SIZE AND CONSTRUCTION  It is fairly large (measuring approximately 15 x 12 x 6 inches) but worth the extra size over the tiny portable units since the quality is extraordinary! It has a big remote (measuring approximately 2.25 x 8.5 x 1 inch) with lots of buttons. What I really like is the remote has a "light" button that illuminates the buttons, so it's super easy to see and use.    OVERALL  Overall, I love this projector. It is exactly what I was looking for and I couldn't be happier with this product!

10858	__label2__	3	N	Video DVD	B005NQ5LSC	The Legend Is Born: Ip Man (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)	Legend is Born: Ip Man	Fans of Ip Man and Ip Man 2 are sure to find their way to this flick, which, if it had been made first would have gone down just fine as an average martial arts movie, but as it came in their shadow feels like a just passable direct-to-video sequel to a well-received blockbuster.<br /><br />I won't get into how much of the story must be pure fabrication for this "biographical" picture, but it serves well enough as a framework to insert action scenes. There is plenty of martial arts skill on display here too, so genre fans shouldn't be disappointed in that. However, a lot of it is simply sparring, or dealing with local bullies, and there's never really that adrenaline-pumping feeling that anything's really at stake for Ip Man.<br /><br />The story does try to insert the drama that will liven up the fight scenes, but it's all hammered into the final act without any build up or tension. However, if you do turn off your brain entirely, the action scenes are entertaining enough to keep Legend is Born from being an abomination, if not a memorable martial arts thrill ride.<br /><br />In the end, Legend is Born is entertaining enough for action fans. It has an interesting, if wildly fictional, story and is well-acted. It's a great movie for a lazy afternoon.

10860	__label2__	2	N	Video DVD	B00HDKJESO	Walking With Dinosaurs (Blu-ray 3D / DVD Combo Pack)	A FILM ONLY FOR CHILDREN, borrowing heavily from Disney's "Dinosaur", "Land before time" and "March of the dinosaurs",	A FILM ONLY FOR CHILDREN, borrowing heavily from Disney's &#34;Dinosaur&#34;, &#34;Land before time&#34; and &#34;March of the dinosaurs&#34;,<br />Even if the title is the same this children oriented film has virtually NOTHING IN COMMON with the ground-breaking 1999 BBC series &#34;Walking with dinosaurs&#34;, as far from being a document, this is in fact a film for kids, in which dinosaurs and birds are intelligent and can talk. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.<br /><br />PARENTAL WARNING! Some scenes in this film can and will TERRIFY youngest children, especially in 3D (both in theaters and at home) - the scariest scenes include very large predators (there are numerous Gorgosaurus in this film) jumping towards the public and seemingly trying to gnaw at the spectators with their mouths (filled with scary looking teeth) wide open and violently snapping. I would rather avoid showing it to children below at least age of 7. There is also a pretty scary and impressive scene of HUGE RAGING FOREST FIRE and some terrified and crying for help pachyrhinosaurus DROWNING in a freezing lake...<br /><br />First, let's stress it again, in this film, like in Disney's 2000 film &#34;Dinosaur&#34; and like in &#34;Land before time&#34; series some dinosaurs (and one bird) are fully intelligent and can talk. Like in Disney's film, we begin with the main hero, a young pachyrhinosaurus named Patchi, being just a hatchling - and the runt of the litter... Patchi, his big bully of brother named Scowler and his other siblings speak, A LOT - on another hand for some reason their parents don't talk. At all.<br /><br />Patchi is very badly treated by his brothers and sisters, but he befriends a prehistoric bird named Alex, who plays with him and talks. A LOT! Later Patchi will meet Juniper, a little female pachyrhinosaurus of same age as him, who will become the love of his life. As you can see, the main dinosaurs here are fully &#34;humanized&#34; as in &#34;Dinosaur&#34;and &#34;Land before time&#34; and they will continue this way during all the film, even when they are fully grown up. On another hand other dinosaurs and other creatures (including some pesky cretaceous mammals) don't speak.<br /><br />This film borrows A LOT from Disney's &#34;Dinosaur&#34;, with Patchi being in many ways similar to Aladar, Juniper being a carbon copy of Neera and especially the character of Scowler being an almost identical twin to Kron. To continue the similarities, bird Alex simply replaces the lemurs and the pack of gorgosaurus takes the place of the pair of carnotaurus. The species are different, but the characters are not... Sorry, SPOILER here: even the final fight was copied from the final confrontation in &#34;Dinosaur&#34;...<br /><br />On another hand, this film is also in large part inspired by a good document called &#34;March of dinosaurs&#34; (see my review of this one) made in 2011 and narrated by Stephen Fry. Both this film and &#34;The March of the dinosaurs&#34; are centered around the yearly migration of a huge herd of dinosaurs living in Cretaceous in North America to the south in autumn and then back to the north in spring. In &#34;The March of the dinosaurs&#34; the main character was a young edmontosaurus called Scar because it was hurt in childhood and the pachyrhinosaurus are secondary characters - here the main hero is a pachyrhinosaurus called Patchi, who was hurt and scarred in childhood and the edmontosaurus are secondary characters... In both films we also meet some gorgosaurus, troodons and scavenging pterosaurs. I personally found &#34;The March of dinosaurs&#34;, which is a document trying to stick very closely to science, much much better and at least as interesting for older children and teenagers.<br /><br />My 12 years old daughter - who likes dinosaurs, monsters, aliens, mutants and anything else that goes nicely with popcorn - enjoyed this film, which contains some pretty humouristic moments, provided mostlyby wise-cracking bird Alex. Me on another hand, I was only partially satisfied, for following reasons:<br /><br />- the images are certainly gorgeous but ultimately not really better than in the &#34;Walking with dinosaurs&#34; which was after all made 14 years ago<br /><br />- the 3D is useful in a couple of sequences (I was really tempted to try to pat a quetzalcoatlus pterosaur on its beak...) but not really so much needed during the rest of the film.<br /><br />- the number of dinosaurs species shown is really rather limited for such a long film - only four species are really shown for any duration (pachyrhinosaurus, gorgosaurus, troodon, edmontosaurus) together with the quetzalcoatlus pterosaurs one bird and a couple of little mammals. There is also one ankylosaurus and a couple of chirostenotes, parksosaurus and hesperonychus all appearing like for 10 seconds... and that is all.<br /><br />- the film doesn't know really where to go. Most of time it is a film purely for children, but then by moments it tries to be also a document - and as a result it is not entirely succesful in either category.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a watchable dinosaur film FOR OLDER CHILDREN and YOUNG TEENAGERS, but nothing else. For adults and older teenagers I really advise to skip it and watch/re-watch other great British dinosaur productions like the original &#34;Walking with dinosaurs&#34; series and &#34;The March of dinosaurs&#34; or the excellent American series &#34;Dinosaur revolution&#34;.

This is a very very basic cover for the ipad. It's not going to take a beating for long and it's not going to last long if you try to beat it up.<br /><br />This is a case that will work well if you have a brief case or bag that you put your ipad in when not in use. It doesn't have a lot of the frills that other cases have though. The case itself is a bit thinner than most of the others that I've used and already I see that the corners are curling up a little. Also the fabric cover around the binding seems very thin and like it will wear through rather quick. I tend to slide my case around on the desk a lot and I see some areas that are already concerning me.<br /><br />Does it hold the ipad though, sure it does. It's not exactly a great fit but it's not a high priced cover either.<br /><br />I can easily see needing 2 of these a year but if you are nice to your case you should be able to get a good year out of it.
10863	__label2__	4	Y	Camera	B00508I2AC	Linco Flora 35 inch Hexogen Easy Softbox	Excellent quality of light but more fiddly than easy	I own a Linco Flora Fluorescent Light Bank. It's a wonderful light head but, if you want to use a softbox, the Linco Flora Hexogen Easy Softbox is the only one that fits it. Conversely, the Easy Softbox only fits the Flora Fluorescent Light Bank.  CONSTRUCTION: The Hexogen is a modified umbrella sans central shaft. It appears well made with heavy duty nylon fabric, reflective interior, steel ribs, plastic nylon hub and a velcro secured white diffusion panel/cloth. Compared to Neewer softboxes, it's heavy duty. Build is similar to LimoStudio softboxes, albeit twice as expensive. While the 35-inch hexagon shape makes nice catchlights, it’s bulky and can’t be rotated for a smaller profile like rectangular softboxes.  SETUP is easier than a standard softbox with component ribs but more fiddly than a umbrella softbox or Brolly box with central shaft. Begin by manually spreading the ribs open. Secure by pulling the string through the center hole until a latch locks in place in. To collapse, press the latch. It’s faster and less fiddly to simply push the hub with my palm until it locks. The pull string is its weakest element, albeit easy to replace if broken. Slow and gentle assembly is recommended and don't muscle or jerk that wee string.  Installation on the Flora Fluorescent Light Bank is fussy compared to a shoot through umbrella or umbrella softbox: align ribs with indentations on the Light Bank, compress hub until you feel a slight give and tighten front and rear thumb wheels. If you don't maintain compression during lockdown, the thumbwheel shaft will not bite into the hub. Setting up the Easy Softbox is marginally faster than a normal softbox. Maybe a minute saved? Nevertheless, it works wonderfully with the Flora Light Bank: pleasingly even and soft light with attractive catchlights. It also looks professional and clients are impressed!  MUSINGS: The Flora Light Bank and Hexogen Easy Softbox are available as a kit but are fifteen or twenty bucks cheaper whenpurchased ala carte. Oddly, neither the head or softbox ship with instructions or even a link to a PDF or video tutorial. Experienced studio shooters will figure out how to assemble and use these products in a couple minutes. After all, they’re similar to other CFL heads and umbrella softboxes. However, a beginner will have a tough time setting it up. The included storage bag is a cruel joke. An inch more in width and length would have made it much easier to fit the folded softbox. I keep the Hexogen in an old Vanguard tripod bag. Finally, unlike some other reviewers, the item I received was emblazon with the Linco Flora logo on both softbox and bag.  FINAL BURB: Improvements I'd like to see are a metal hub, stronger pull cord, larger storage bag and enclosed instructions. It’s pricy compared to my LimoStudio softboxes but the Hexogen Easy Softbox is a solid product: integrates well with the Flora Light Bank, boasts quality materials and construction and renders pleasingly soft light.

10866	__label2__	2	N	Furniture	B008P7T4LQ	South Shore Morgan Collection Storage Cabinet, Royal Cherry	Heavy, not real wood, chipped and scratched, looks fine...	Stay away from this product. Go to IKEA (much better quality) or any local store. Basically, you'll get a higher quality product at a lower price. I guess if you don't have an Ikea or a similar store anywhere near by...<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Color is a nice darker cherry/<br />- Marker included (more on this later)<br /><br />Neutral:<br />- Very heavy. At around 125 pounds, I was expecting it to have some solid wood pieces, mixed in with some laminate ones. However, it's all laminate, not one piece of it is made of real wood.<br />- Putting it together was cumbersome but relatively straight forward, you have to hammer in a few pieces (per the instructions) that on other similar products you typically screw in.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Every single one of the 10 or so "wood" pieces was scratched. Not one of them came in perfect shape. Vendor is well aware of it, as they send you a brown market to paint over the chipped/scratched sections. The good thing I can say, is that the marker hides those defects effectively. (one of the reasons this gets 2 stars instead of just 1)<br />- Instructions are poor. In one page they will tell you to attached something one way, in the next page the drawing will have them a different way. (the first page was right...)<br />- Hard to align, any slight push from the side readjusts it slightly. lets say align: | |  push a bit to accommodate to a corner and it ends up: / / (obviously not that inclined, but it doesn't keep its shape very well).<br />- Expensive. At around 200 dollars, I was expecting a slightly higher quality product. Say a grade or two above Ikea, as opposed to much lesser quality.<br /><br />If this was made of real wood, (or have at least the outer more visible pieces (say the doors) made of real wood, and scratches were limited, the product would have been a 4 star product. As it stands, given the price tag, and what similar products can be had for at IKEA, I cannot recommend this cabinet.

The two had never been close and hadn't spoken since her husband died a few years before.  Joanna is convinced that her late husband, Max, is haunting her and wants Emma to make him go away.  A few hours later, Emma learns that Joanna's daughter Lainey is in a mental health facility after three attempts to commit suicide.  Lainey and Emma's own daughter are good friends, so Emma pays the young woman a visit.  After the talk, Emma thinks that a ghost might be involved in Lainey's attempts on her own life.  But is it Max or someone else?  Can Emma figure out the cause in time to keep Lainey safe?  I've enjoyed the previous two books in this series, and this was the strongest yet.  The characters, both living and ghostly, are vivid and pull you into the story.  There were times some of the characters were doing some stupid things, but even then I usually felt sorry for them.  The plot moves forward on two levels involving the present and the past.  Both mysteries are compelling, although I usually found myself more involved in the modern mystery.  Yet the historic mystery packed a real emotional punch in the end.  There was a sub-plot I didn't like because Emma was being stupid and complicating her life.  I'll be looking forward to seeing how that gets resolved in future books.  This is a compelling read with great characters that will keep you turning pages until you reach the end.

The torque on this drill is obvious when you use it the first time.  this has a dial clutch actuator, so you can choose any torque limit you wish - and the lowest torque setting is a good place to start with small screws! When the drill reaches the torque setting, the drill stops. This drill is well-designed and well-engineered.  It is ideal for tight quarters.<br /><br />The LED is bright and illuminates the workspace well.  When maximum torque is achieved the LED changes to red when the drill stops.  Nice feature.<br /><br />The advantage of the bare tool is that you don't have to buy additional batteries and chargers.  It does not come in a plastic box - which would have been a nice addition.  It uses the new M-18 batteries.<br /><br />Great drill.  Recommended.

Very Tasty and Nutricious Snack	This was my first taste of Spirulina and it is very tasty.  This bar is great as a snack, or for breakfast with an energy drink.  It has just enough calories that with a drink it can serve as a meal replacement and is full of nutrition.  Recommend it for anyone new to Spirulina cause I have tried other Spirulina bars that are not as novice friendly.

There was a lot of excellent singing and dancing to keep ones interest and entertainment. With a movie that also includes Jane Wyman, Mary Martin and Eve Arden you can not go wrong. The other three movies were marginally watchable.  My Favorite Wife was much too silly, Mr. Blanding Builds His Dream House was quite boring. The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer was mostly OK but had a couple of ridiculous scenes that caused a reduced enjoyment. However, it was interesting to see a young Shirley Temple again.

It's a well made seat and the handles are great, however my son doesn't sit as securely on it as he does on the Baby Bjorn seat.  So he tends to pee over the splash guard almost every time he uses it.  In this price range, it is a decent seat with a long enough hole for an almost 40 lb and tall toddler to use.  I just think you get what you pay for.
10885	__label2__	5	N	Video DVD	B000J103PC	The Devil Wears Prada (Widescreen Edition)	"Oh, I'm sorry, do you have some prior committment? Some hideous skirt convention you have to go to?"	Pound for pound, no one lays on the vicious snark like a woman targeting another woman. THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA explores a corner of the cutthroat fashion industry, a nerve-wracking environment replete with competitive jealousies and general, all-around meanspiritedness. Into this world steps Anne Hathaway's character, Andrea "Andy" Sachs, an aspiring journalist eager to get a foot in the door. To gain invaluable experience, Andy interviews for a job as the assistant's assistant to the ridiculously demanding Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), acclaimed head of the trend-setting Runway magazine.<br /><br />Andy is a size six, and this automatically makes her the brunt of mean jokes by those in her new work office. Andy comes from a down-to-earth place and sort of scoffs at her co-workers' unending obsession with haute couture. She promises her boyfriend cook Nate (Adrian Grenier) that she won't change. But of course she does. Andy loses her way.<br /><br />Meryl Streep submits yet another powerhouse performance as the film's dragon lady. Miranda Priestly is the sort of boss who can effortlessly, whimsically shatter an employee's self-esteem. I take in the twitchy reactions of those in her circle and how they tiptoe on eggshells whenever she's in the room, and even I start to sweat. But Meryl Streep is able to sneak in an echo of vulnerability. You may end up sympathizing with her a bit. This actress is just so consistently good.<br /><br />Stanley Tucci himself is masterful in another of his side character roles. I think every movie should have Stanley Tucci in it. Emily Blunt as Miranda Priestly's frazzled first assistant - and Andy's primary foil - is fun to watch, and she makes the most out of her thankless role. When THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA first released in 2006, Anne Hathaway was only then just starting to distance herself from her wholesome teen princess roles. So she was a question mark, going into this film, even with HAVOC and BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN in her rearview.No worries, she confidently steps into this post-Disney role, and she's quite good.<br /><br />Because there's something innately appealing about Hathaway. Even when her character does eventually sell out, you don't hate her. You're not mad-dogging her. You just want her to get back on track. The film easily develops a rooting interest for her. Her immediate boss, the first assistant, is so cruddy in her behavior towards Andy that Andy right away falls into that underdog slot. Except she overcomes that soon enough. Andy, who is brainy enough that she rejected Stanford Law to pursue her journalistic dreams, turns out to be endlessly resourceful in meeting Miranda Priestly's incessant, impossible demands. It's not too long before the first assistant is demoted. Yay for Andy. You could feel her getting more and more sucked into this seductive world. Her long-suffering boyfriend's patience is wearing thin.<br /><br />This film renders me a stranger in a strange land, forced to absorb exotic name brands like Prada, Valentino Garavani, Giorgio Armani, and others I would have to look up on Wiki. I desperately longed for someone to name drop the Gap or Old Navy or Fruit of the Loom, something familiar. Gratifyingly, the story drew me in. The acting fixated me to the screen. I laughed at the right bits and scornfully rolled my eyes at the sheer fanaticism these frantic characters invested in mere articles of clothing. I then went to sleep in my awesome grown-up Underoos.
10886	__label2__	3	N	PC	B00CPH56AU	Belkin @TV Premium - Mobile Television Anywhere (Product and Service Have Been Discontinued by Manufacturer)	Not completely satisfied	The first issue I had with the Belkin @TV was that it has a component/composite connection.  I was already using these connectors on my dvr to hook up another piece of equipment.  It took me a little time (and extra purchase) to get the @TV connected.  Once I had it connected, I then went to download and install the app on my android phone, which I thought was free.  When I saw the fee for it, I was taken aback.  I "know" that before getting the @TV system, that I had read it was free.  I went back onto Amazon and reread everything.  Then I realized the tricky (in my opinion) wordplay where it says free tablet app.  No, they were not lying, but it's a slight bit shady (once again, in my opinion).  So I then paid the money for the app, on top of the extra money I needed to spend to hook up the connectors.  I've used a slingplayer in the past and understand that the system is going to occasionally have some glitches.  I had problems viewing on my phone more often than I did with the old slingplayer I had used.  Since I have it installed and paid for the app, I will continue to use it some on a limited basis I guess.  Hopefully either future app updates or software upgrades to the system will help things run a bit more smoothly.

10889	__label2__	4	N	Video DVD	B007X0TTXE	Don 2 [Blu-ray] (Shah Rukh Khan / Hindi Movie / Bollywood Film / Indian Cinema)	It is not just difficult to predict all the plot twists in Don 2, it's impossible!	That review title above is a straight up fib. It's not at all difficult to predict all the plot twists in DON 2. But so what? For fans of Shahrukh Khan and for those who relish slick action thrillers, DON 2 checks all the boxes. It's been five years since the events in DON, five years since that shocking final reveal. But some things don't change. These days, our guy is still running game on the underworld, still outfoxing the badge and his competitors. The woman he betrayed, Roma Bhagat (Priyanka Chopra), is now an Interpol officer. She's obsessed with nabbing him.<br /><br />The film opens with Don holding it down as the undisputed kingpin of the Asian underworld, except that he's now got his eye on a take over of the European drug cartel. On the French Riviera, the European bosses attend an emergency meeting to discuss Don's recent actions. Don is jeopardizing their drug empire by undercutting the asking price of their product. What they decide on is inevitable.<br /><br />Back in Malaysia, Don gets wind of the contract on his head in the rudest of manners. There and then, he determines to be a free man once and for all. He sets into motion one of those whirlwind capers, key elements of which hinge on the springing of his old enemy from prison (Boman Irani) and a daring heist in Berlin. But Don finds himself navigating a nest of vipers, his accomplices composed of deceitful villains. With law enforcement nipping at his heels, has Don at last bitten off more than he can chew? Or does that iconic phrase still hold true? "Don ko pakadna mushkil hi nahi, namumkim hai." Translation: "It is not just difficult to catch Don, it's impossible!"<br /><br />If you're anticipating a retread of the 2006 film, you need to turn in your anticipating badge. For one thing, there aren't so many swerves in this one. Don does assume a disguise, but it's not as relevant to the plot as much as it is a chance to showcase Hrithik Roshan in a cool cameo (Hrithik even dances with Priyanka).And if that really is Hrithik saying Don's dialogue, then big ups to him for nicely matching Shahrukh's voice and cadence. Don is so gifted, as part of his disguise, he grew a few inches.<br /><br />I thought Priyanka Chopra did well in a role that required her character, Roma, to be conflicted. Don is so magnetic that Roma still can't help but feel that attraction, never mind that Don had betrayed her, never mind that he'd murdered her brother. Thankfully, the film keeps this sub-plot mostly on simmer, never allows it to take over the narrative. Lara Dutta has a lesser role, filling in for Ishaa Koppikar as Don's most trusted companion. Both women look absolutely devastating!<br /><br />The manly man's credo: Give me my popcorn and a comfy sofa and babes to ogle and lots of fight scenes and explosions... and I'm good. Because sometimes and maybe most times, I dispense with the artsy-fartsy stuff and I demand to be entertained by a loud action blockbuster. DON 2 lacks the smarts and fascinating twists of the 2006 film. And I don't know that it was a sound move to inject a sliver of conscience into Don. What made him unique was that he was an unrepentant anti-hero, a straight up, no good villain. Or maybe it doesn't matter. Shahrukh Khan's larger-than-life charisma and his showmanship are stamped onto the screen and your eyes are glued to the guy. Shahrukh also performs his own stunts, again perpetuating the notion that absolutely no one can fill his shoes. I guess, one other contention is that I prefer Don to apply his wits to achieve his ends. Here, he frequently resorts to action hero methods. Ultimately, the 2006 film had built up so much cachet I can't dog on its sequel too much. DON 2 is the Hindi version of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. It's over-the-top and preposterous and great bloody fun. As a fan of Bollywood cinema, I think it's always a treat whenever Boman Irani plays the bad guy. Whether in drama or thriller or comedy, Boman Irani is effortless. There aren't alot of musical numbers here (I think, three). But the tracks all carry strains of "Main Hoon Don," a club banger from the 2006 film and one of the most addictive, catchy Bollywood songs ever. Okay, another beef? How much more clever would it have been if, instead of Hrithik Roshan, it was Abhishek Bachan whose face Don assumes? Abhishek looks enough like his dad, Amitabh, who played the original Don in 1978, that the reference would've been awesome.<br /><br />What I have is the 2-disc DVD set. Disc 1 has the feature presentation, available with English sub-titles and the option to jump to any of the film's three musical segments (this last feature is also available on Disc 2). Disc 2 has the following bonus features:<br /><br />- Making Of featurette (mostly in English, running time 40 minutes)<br />- Songs: "Zaraa Dil Ko Thaam Lo," Hai Ye Maya," "Dushman Mera"<br />- (Promotional?) Music Video from DON 2 featuring Shahrukh Khan: "Mujhko Pehchaanlo"

10891	__label2__	5	N	Outdoors	B00BUI7HFC	Scrubba Portable Laundry System Wash Bag	THIS works, but you have to understand who it is for!	This product is designed for those who love to spend time in the great outdoors.  Usually you can find a fast moving stream or lake to do your laundry in.  However, many other alternatives to this bag are prone to break or fall apart after a few uses.  This bag is meant to last.  I have never been a fan of using any kind of soap or detergent when in the outdoors.  First off it is not ecologically a good idea to use regular cleaning soap in the outdoors.  You have to worry about polluting the waterways and you also have to be concerned about the smell.  Any kind of smell to soap or other things you use on your body will attract things you do not want near you!!!!  Think insects, bears, etc.........  While those creatures love the smell of city folk.............those who are backpackers or hunters know you do not want to be dinner for the mosquito.  I use a non scented, non polluting soap for washing both clothes and body.  With this little guy you can easily do both.  No need to carry special soap....all you do is take your body soap and shave off a bit with your knife....and place in the bag.  This bag is made to last.  I imagine it will be the last one you ever have to buy.
10892	__label2__	5	N	Camera	B00U2GSQE4	XSories Stuffler 23L Duffel Waterproof Bag with Adjustable Shoulder Strap for Wet or Dry Storage (Orange)	light and bright	Recently a family friend was cleaning out his garage and gave us an old kayak, so we've been tooling around in the bay, learning as we go. One thing we didn't realize we needed was a small dry bag to pack different things in (towel, change of clothes, phone, camera, lunch, whatever) to bring with us, because the kayak lets in water and things get damp very easily.<br /><br />This bag is perfect for that- it's very roomy, but still compact enough that it fits neatly in the boat without taking much room. The orange color is a benefit, because if it does go overboard, or if you leave it on the shore, you can easily spot it from a distance. So far, we've not had the opportunity to set it in the water and leave it for several hours to test just *how* waterproof it is, but it has held up in regular use and in rainy conditions.<br /><br />Perfect bag for kayaking and other water-based sports.

10895	__label2__	5	N	Video DVD	B0007XBKOA	Windtalkers	WINDTALKERS Draws Attention to Forgotten Heroes.	WINDTALKERS is a good WWII movies filmed over the past few years in that brings attention to these uniquely qualified men of war to draw upon their heritage in this time of global conflict. It is a multi-layered and multi-faceted tale told visually through incredible images enhanced with armor piercing sound effects. The dialogue really has to take a back seat to this simple tale of men and their survival because the images of the land, the bleak faces and the carnage tell it all. This film is named WINDTALKERS but the film does not really focus on the code developed by the Navajo Marines. Director Raoul Walsh had peripherally addressed the Navajo code in 1955 with his film BATTLE CRY with Felix Noriego as Marine Crazy Horse where we saw Japanese operators baffled while listening in on radio and field-telephone transmissions. Director John Woo, as did Raoul Walsh, decides to focus his attention on the men and their diverse backgrounds and what makes them Marines. However, Woo narrows his focus on the relationship between a war-weary, shell-shocked and enigmatic Marine sergeant (Nicolas Cage) and a good-natured naive Navajo recruit (Adam Beach) assigned to him. Beach can't understand the actions or behavior of loner Cage's intensity for killing and bloodshed but learns eventually that if you survive you then increase your chances of having your comrades around you survive as well. Woo is a director noted for action and WINDTALKERS contains some of the most frenetically staged sequences ever filmed. These sequences reminded me of some of Sam Peckinpah's cathartic work from THE WILD BUNCH, the montages of the combat maelstrom of his CROSS OF IRON and the intensity of the intimate fighting of combatants from Edward Zwick's Civil War epic GLORY. This is not action for the sake of action that can be easily labeled on John Woo. Woo is making a statement that all this carnage can be addictive yet simultaneously it usually creates and strengthens intimate camaraderie. But you really can never afford to be close to any of your buddies and this is a highly moral conflict. Is battle weary hardness a symptom or a mechanism to survive? This is the price of defending the ideals that we hold so dear. This is a very subtle and great film that can be easily glossed right over for its true meaning and realization. WINDTALKERS draws attention to forgotten heroes.

10899	__label2__	5	N	Grocery	B00DBSG80O	Cheez-It Cracker Cup, White Cheddar, 2.2 Ounce (Pack of 10)	Cup container is handy for snacking while driving	These Cheez-It cups are very handy when you want a snack while driving. I find it's easier to reach into the cup and grab a few crackers than into a bag, while trying to keep my eyes on the road. The Cheez-It cup fits into my car's large cup holder, so it's within easy reach and I don't spill them everywhere. The white chedar crackers are milder than the original cheese flavor, but still taste just as great.<br /><br />I like the size and find these are a great teen/adult size snack. We have all kinds of snack packs in our pantry, since I buy for my kids school lunches. They're all quite small. They are usually even smaller than you would get out of a vending machine. I like the larger size of these cups, since generally when I want a snack, it's because I'm really hungry and didn't have time to eat anything. I'd rather just take one 2 oz cup like this with me than 2 or 3 little tiny kid's lunch baggies. I like the size. Perfect for when you're on the go.

It smells more like medicine than Jasmine and did nothing for their dry skin. Although the bottle itself works great and the price is cheaper on Amazon, it still isn't worth it. Even common pet store shampoos like Furminator and Pet Head are better than this. If you are looking for a natural shampoo that does a great job try Royal Treatment instead of wasting your money on RELIQ.
